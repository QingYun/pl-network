Scala has full support for functional programming and a very strong static type system. This allows programs written in Scala to be very concise and thus smaller in size than other general-purpose programming languages. Many of Scala's design decisions were inspired by criticism of the shortcomings of Java.\\nScala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that the resulting executable code runs on a Java virtual machine. Java libraries may be used directly in Scala code and vice versa. Like Java, Scala is object-oriented, and uses a curly-brace syntax reminiscent of the C programming language. Unlike Java, Scala has many features of functional programming languages like Scheme, Standard ML and Haskell, including currying, type inference, immutability, lazy evaluation, and pattern matching. It also has an advanced type system supporting algebraic data types, covariance and contravariance, higher-order types, and anonymous types. Other features of Scala not present in Java include operator overloading, optional parameters, named parameters, raw strings, and no checked exceptions."],"rdfs:label":["Scala"],"key:en":["scala_programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.official_website":["<http://www.scala-lang.org/>"],"ns:common.topic.social_media_presence":["<https://twitter.com/scala_lang>"],"ns:base.schemastaging.context_name.pronunciation":[{"ns:base.schemastaging.pronunciation.yomigana":["スカラ"],"rdf:type":["ns:base.schemastaging.pronunciation"]}],"ns:common.topic.subject_of":["Edward Beckett"],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.description":["The Scala Programming Language"],"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bl3s35"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.scala-lang.org>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.091hdj"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.developers":["Bill Venners"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["Martin Odersky"],"ns:book.book_subject.works":[{"ns:book.written_work.copyright_date":["2007"],"ns:book.written_work.date_of_first_publication":["2008-11-17"],"rdfs:label":["Programming in Scala"],"key:en":["programming_in_scala"],"ns:book.written_work.original_language":["ns:m.02h40lc"],"ns:common.topic.image":["ns:m.075yfzs"],"ns:book.book.editions":["ns:m.0c4y6w1"],"ns:type.object.name":["Programming in Scala"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.topic"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:book.book"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125b2pg7h"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xryvm"],"ns:book.written_work.author":["ns:m.05kh714"],"ns:book.written_work.subjects":["ns:m.091hdj"]}],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.text":["Scala ( /ˈskɑːlə/ SKAH-lə) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed to integrate features of object-oriented programming and functional programming. The name Scala is a blend of \\\"scalable\\\" and \\\"language\\\", signifying that it is designed to grow with the demands of its users. James Strachan, the creator of Groovy, described Scala as a possible successor to Java.\\nThe design of Scala started in 2001 at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) by Martin Odersky, following on from work on Funnel, a programming language combining ideas from functional programming and Petri nets. Odersky had previously worked on Generic Java and javac, Sun's Java compiler.\\nScala was released late 2003 / early 2004 on the Java platform, and on the .NET platform in June 2004. A second version of the language, v2.0, was released in March 2006.\\nOn 17 January 2011 the Scala team won a 5 year research grant of over €2.3 million from the European Research Council. On 12 May 2011, Odersky and collaborators launched Typesafe, a company to provide commercial support, training, and services for Scala. Typesafe received $3 million investment from Greylock Partners.\\nScala runs on the Java platform"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/3254510>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:event.speech_topic.speeches_or_presentations_on_this_topic":[{"ns:event.speech_or_presentation.event":["ns:m.0g5kw1_"],"ns:event.speech_or_presentation.speaker_s":["ns:m.0g5nm7h"],"ns:event.speech_or_presentation.presented_work":["ns:m.0g5nm7l"],"rdf:type":["ns:event.speech_or_presentation"],"ns:event.speech_or_presentation.speech_topic":["ns:m.091hdj"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2003"],"ns:type.object.name":["Scala"],"rdf:type":["ns:event.speech_topic"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1256gx0r4"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.0k9hf94"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.07phw8"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0pkgc"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.07sbkfb"]}}
