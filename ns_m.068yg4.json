It is a complete revision that aims to simplify the older Managed C++ syntax (which is now deprecated). C++/CLI is standardized by Ecma as ECMA-372. It is currently available only in Visual Studio 2005, 2008, 2010 and 11 beta (also included in the Express Editions).\\nC++/CLI should be thought of as a language of its own (with a new set of keywords, for example), instead of the C++ superset-oriented Managed C++ (MC++) (whose non-standard keywords were styled like __gc orÂ __value). Because of this, there are some major syntactic changes, especially related to the elimination of ambiguous identifiers and the addition of .NET-specific features.\\nMany conflicting syntaxes, such as the multiple versions of operator new() in MC++ have been split: in C++/CLI, .NET reference types are created with the new keyword gcnew. Also, C++/CLI has introduced the concept of generics (conceptually similar to standard C++ templates, but quite different in their implementation).\\nIn MC++, there were two different types of pointers: __nogc pointers were normal C++ pointers, while"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/1957924>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["C++/CLI"],"rdf:type":["ns:user.doconnor.industry_standards.standard"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12554lxj_"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.05_mgr"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.0jgqg"]}}
