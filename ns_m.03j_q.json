It is named after logician Haskell Curry. In Haskell, \\\"a function is a first-class citizen\\\" of the programming language. As a functional programming language, the primary control construct is the function. The language is rooted in the observations of Haskell Curry and his intellectual descendants, that \\\"a proof is a program; the formula it proves is a type for the program\\\".\\nFollowing the release of Miranda by Research Software Ltd, in 1985, interest in lazy functional languages grew: by 1987, more than a dozen non-strict, purely functional programming languages existed. Of these, Miranda was the most widely used, but was not in the public domain. At the conference on Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture (FPCA '87) in Portland, Oregon, a meeting was held during which participants formed a strong consensus that a committee should be formed to define an open standard for such languages. The committee's purpose was to consolidate the existing functional languages into a common one that would serve as a basis for future"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/27404990>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0blczn8"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.haskell.org/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.03j_q"]}],"ns:book.book_subject.works":[{"ns:book.written_work.date_of_first_publication":["2008-12-05"],"rdfs:label":["Real World Haskell"],"ns:common.topic.topical_webpage":["<http://www.realworldhaskell.org/blog/>"],"ns:book.book.genre":[],"ns:book.written_work.subjects":["ns:m.03j_q"],"ns:book.written_work.original_language":["ns:m.02h40lc"],"ns:common.topic.image":["ns:m.04gd6l4"],"ns:common.topic.webpage":["ns:m.04gd6kr"],"ns:book.book.editions":["ns:m.0c9p0zl"],"ns:type.object.name":["Real World Haskell"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.topic"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:book.book"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1257cwdhx"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xryvm"],"ns:book.written_work.author":["ns:m.0gg59p5"],"ns:common.topic.description":["Real World Haskell is an O'Reilly Media book, ISBN 978-0-596-51498-3, about the Haskell programming language by Bryan O'Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen and features a rhinoceros beetle as its mascot.
