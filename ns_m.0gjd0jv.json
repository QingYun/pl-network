Variable assignment is done with a colon (:).\\nDuring translation, the values of the variables are inserted into the output CSS document.\\nThe above code in LESS would compile to following CSS code.\\nMixins allow embedding all the properties of a class into another class by including the class name as one of its properties, thus behaving as a sort of constant or variable. They can also behave like functions, and take arguments.
