It runs on Unix-like and Linux based operating systems, as well as Windows.\\nMagma is produced and distributed by the Computational Algebra Group within the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Sydney.\\nIn late 2006, the book Discovering Mathematics with Magma was published by Springer as volume 19 of the Algorithms and Computations in Mathematics series.\\nThe Magma system is used extensively within pure mathematics. The Computational Algebra Group maintain a list of publications which cite Magma, and as of 2010 there are about 2600 citations, mostly in pure mathematics, but also including papers from areas as diverse as economics and geophysics.\\nThe predecessor of the Magma system was named Cayley (1982â€“1993), after Arthur Cayley.\\nMagma was officially released in August 1993 (version 1.0). Version 2.0 of Magma was released in June 1996 and subsequent versions of 2.X have been released approximately once per year."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/98628>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Magma"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125g11594"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
