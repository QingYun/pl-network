It's thread-capable, embeddable, weakly typed language with optional strong typing and procedural and object-oriented features designed for anything from quick scripting to complex multithreaded, network-aware application development to embedded application scripting. Qore was initially designed to facilitate the rapid implementation of sophisticated interfaces in embedded code in an enterprise environment, and has since grown into a general-purpose language as well.\\nQore syntax is similar to other programming languages (highly similar to Perl), allowing new programmers to rapidly come up to speed in Qore. Qore borrows features from languages such as: C++ (ex: multiple inheritance, exception handling, static methods), Java (ex: the synchronized keyword, the instanceof operator, object and class implementation), Perl (ex: the foreach statement, splice, push, pop, chomp, splice operators, perl5-compatible regular expressions, and more), the D Programming Language (the on_exit, on_success, and on_error statements provide exception-aware functionality similar to scope(exit), scope(failure), allowing"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/33850384>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Qore"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1q5jzw5m0"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.05zrn"]}}
