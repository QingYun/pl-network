Its interactive interpreter is available under GPL. The language and its implementation were designed by Scott Hunziker and Mike Brennan starting in 1994.\\nThe syntax of Algae is largely drawn from C. The semantics, however, are more similar to a dynamic programming language such as Perl or an interactive technical-computing language such as MATLAB. Built-in data types for matrices and operators for matrix arithmetic are provided.\\nThese examples are from the official Algae manual (reference: algae.sourceforge.net/algae_3.html#SEC3):\\nBoth the question mark and semicolon are statement terminators. When ? is used, the return value of the statement is printed to the user's console.\\nThe CLI interpreter by Hunziker and Brennan is the single implementation of Algae. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License. It is compatible with Unix-based operating systems. It has not been ported to non-Unix operating system such as Microsoft Windows. The interpreter is designed to used interactively. As of 2007 the Algae interpreter appears to be unmaintained, with the source code and distribution web"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/2455717>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Algae programming language"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125dkwt04"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
