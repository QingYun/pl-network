Go was officially announced in November 2009. In May 2010, Rob Pike publicly stated that Go was being used \\\"for real stuff\\\" at Google. Go's \\\"gc\\\" compiler targets the Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9 and Microsoft Windows operating systems and the i386, amd64, and ARM processor architectures.\\nGo aims to provide the efficiency of a statically typed compiled language with the ease of programming of a dynamic language. Other goals include:\\nThe syntax of Go is broadly similar to that of C: blocks of code are surrounded with curly braces; common control flow structures include for, switch, and if. Unlike C, line-ending semicolons are optional; variable declarations are written differently and are usually optional; type conversions must be made explicit; and new go and select control keywords have been introduced to support concurrent programming. New built-in types include maps, Unicode strings, array slices, and channels for inter-thread communication.\\nGo is designed for"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/25039021>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.image":[{"ns:type.content.blob_id":["396a8e76806e7432aaa4003bad81c5e375472cc9b54d9f3b44cdfb785c36c718"],"ns:type.content.length":["4055"],"rdfs:label":["Gopher"],"ns:common.image.image_caption":["This is a logo for Go (programming language)."],"ns:common.image.size":["ns:m.029sf1n"],"ns:common.licensed_object.license":["ns:m.02x6b"],"ns:type.content.language":["ns:m.04l"],"ns:type.content.media_type":["ns:m.08y0"],"ns:type.content.uploaded_by":["ns:m.0cgxypv"],"ns:type.content.source":["ns:m.0cgy0gv"],"ns:type.object.name":["Gopher"],"rdf:type":["ns:type.content"],"ns:common.image.appears_in_topic_gallery":["ns:m.09gbxjr"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2009-11-10"],"ns:type.object.name":["Go"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1256f1gfy"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.07phw8"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.09gdqsb"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
