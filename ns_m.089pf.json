It is targeted at the clear specification of computer programs and computer-based systems in general.\\nIn 1974, Jean-Raymond Abrial published \\\"Data Semantics\\\". He used a notation that would later be taught in the University of Grenoble until the end of the 1980s. While at EDF (Électricité de France), Abrial wrote internal notes on Z. The Z notation is used in the 1980 book Méthodes de programmation.\\nZ was originally proposed by Abrial in 1977 with the help of Steve Schuman and Bertrand Meyer. It was developed further at the Programming Research Group at Oxford University, where Abrial worked in the early 1980s, having arrived at Oxford in September 1979.\\nAbrial answers the question \\\"Why Z?\\\" with \\\"Because it is the ultimate language!\\\"\\nZ is based on the standard mathematical notation used in axiomatic set theory, lambda calculus, and first-order predicate logic. All expressions in Z notation are typed, thereby avoiding some of the paradoxes of naive set theory.
