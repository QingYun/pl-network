Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz.\\nWhen True BASIC appeared on the market in 1985, initially based on Dartmouth BASIC 7 — otherwise known as ANSI BASIC — it implemented a number of new features over GW-BASIC, and allowed the user a redefinable 16-color, 640×480 pixel backdrop for program editing. True BASIC introduced new functions for graphics primitives like plot, plot area, flood, etc. It also was the first to provide a method for saving a portion of the screen and blitting it elsewhere, but had no proper buffering implementation.\\nBeing a structured programming implementation of the language, it dispensed with the need for line numbers and GOTO statements, although these earlier features can still be used. Use of LET for value assignment became optional. It also allowed for descriptive variable names longer than a single letter plus a single digit. For example, the familiar algebraic equation y = mx + b (y = mx + c for the UK) could be expressed as:\\nThe above code segment would yield \\\"y2= 10\\\".\\nTrue BASIC provides statements for matrix"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/31382>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.truebasic.com/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.07qb7"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["True BASIC"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1258kfd6w"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
