It also included the string type for easier text manipulation.\\nSMALL was used extensively from about 1980 to 1985 at Auckland University as a programming teaching aid, and for some internal projects. Originally written to run on a Burroughs Corporation B6700 Main frame in Fortran IV, subsequently rewritten in SMALL and ported to a DEC PDP-10 Architecture (on the Operating System TOPS-10) and IBM S360 Architecture (on the Operating System VM/CMS).\\nAbout 1985, SMALL had some object-oriented features added to handle structures (that were missing from the early language), and to formalise file manipulation operations."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/1808130>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["SMALL"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1259rkn4m"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"]}}
