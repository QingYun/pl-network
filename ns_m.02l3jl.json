Support for the Prograph language on Mac OS X has recently reappeared with the release of the Marten software development environment.\\nResearch on Prograph started at Acadia University in 1982 as a general investigation into dataflow languages, stimulated by a seminar on functional languages conducted by Michael Levin. Diagrams were used to clarify the discussion, leading to the insight: \\\"since the diagrams are clearer than the code, why not make the diagrams themselves executable!\\\" Thus Prograph - Programming in Graphics - was born as a visual dataflow language. This work was led by Dr. Tomasz Pietrzykowski, with Stan Matwin and Thomas Muldner co-authoring early papers. From 1983 to 1985, research prototypes were built on a Three Rivers PERQ graphics workstation (in Pascal, with the data visualized"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/521637>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.image":[{"ns:type.content.length":["11562"],"ns:type.content.blob_id":["734c835c1f6cfa86538af37f306afe92c831339d0d14d1c2e20411a8d4cc21bc"],"rdfs:label":["Prograph cpx logo"],"ns:common.licensed_object.license":["ns:m.02x6b"],"ns:common.image.size":["ns:m.041c2fx"],"ns:type.content.source":["ns:m.041c2h6"],"ns:type.content.media_type":["ns:m.08y0"],"ns:type.object.name":["Prograph cpx logo"],"rdf:type":["ns:type.content"],"ns:common.image.appears_in_topic_gallery":["ns:m.02l3jl"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1983"],"ns:type.object.name":["Prograph"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125677f78"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
