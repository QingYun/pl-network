The most prominent feature of Stackless is microthreads, which avoid much of the overhead associated with usual operating system threads. In addition to Python features, Stackless also adds support for coroutines, communication channels and task serialization.\\nStackless microthreads are managed by the language interpreter itself, not the operating system kernel—context switching and task scheduling is done purely in the interpreter (these are thus also regarded as a form of green thread). This avoids many of the overheads of threads, because no mode switching between user mode and kernel mode needs to be done, and can significantly reduce CPU load in some high-concurrency situations.\\nDue to the considerable number of changes in the source, Stackless Python cannot be installed on a preexisting Python installation as an extension or library. It is instead a complete Python distribution in itself. The majority of Stackless' features have also been implemented in PyPy, a self-hosting Python interpreter and JIT compiler.\\nAlthough the"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/2009536>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Stackless Python"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125c6_mh8"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.05z1_"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.05z1_"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.07phw8"]}}
