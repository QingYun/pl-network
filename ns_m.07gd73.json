Like Objective-C, Objective Modula-2 is a reflective, object oriented programming language with both static and dynamic typing. \\n\\nIt is intended as a safer alternative to Objective-C for Cocoa and GNUstep software development. It retains most of Modula-2's features, most importantly data encapsulation with nested modules, explicit import and export lists and strict type checking. Objective Modula-2 can therefore be considered a much safer programming language than is Objective-C, yet it has all the capabilities of Objective-C. Classes written in Objective Modula-2 can be used within Objective-C and vice versa. \\n\\nObjective Modula-2 is a \\\"thin\\\" layer on top of Modula-2. It is a superset of the Modula-2 base language. Objective Modula-2 borrows its syntax from both Modula-2 and Objective-C. Most of the syntax, including conventional function calls, is inherited from Modula-2, while the syntax for object-oriented features, including message-passing, is borrowed from Objective-C, which itself derived"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/2471974>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Objective Modula-2"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1257l8cgq"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0kzb_"]}}
