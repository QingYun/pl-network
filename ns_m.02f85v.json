It was created and implemented by Sam Moses and Andrei Remenchuck as a simpler means of creating dynamic web applications. The language bindings are available for variety of web server platforms including Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Solaris on SPARC.\\nScripting languages tend to work with a 'full control' approach to documents (scripts) on which they operate. On input they want to be able to parse everything which isn't explicitly marked, and on the output side nothing comes through by default.\\nShorthand, on the other hand, doesn't see itself as being the end of the line for a text stream. It practices 'hands off' and passes the text through unless it sees special tags; then it goes to work, and outputs anything desired right there. This means that it can act as a pre- or post-processor without being invasive.\\nThe language aims to balance ease of use, eloquent grammar, and the kind of robust functionality one would expect to see from a mainstream scripting language.\\nShorthand offers a variety of features such as, native MySQL integration, ODBC, dynamic Server-side_include,"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/477495>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Shorthand Language"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12564bbkj"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
