{"ns:m.0dbjtf":{"ns:common.topic.description":["Haxe is an open source high-level multi-platform programming language and compiler that can produce applications and source code for many different platforms from a single code-base.\\nHaxe includes a set of common functionality that is supported across all platforms, such as numeric data types, text, arrays, binary and some common file formats. Haxe also includes platform-specific API for Adobe Flash, C++, PHP and other languages.\\nCode written in the Haxe language can be source-to-source compiled into ActionScript 3 code, JavaScript programs, Java, C#, C++ standalone applications, Python, PHP, Apache CGI, and Node.js server-side applications.\\nHaxe is also a full-featured ActionScript 3-compatible Adobe Flash compiler, that can compile a SWF file directly from Haxe code. Haxe can also compile to Neko applications, built by the same developer.\\nMajor users of Haxe include TiVo, Prezi, Nickelodeon, Disney, Mattel, Hasbro, Coca Cola, Toyota and BBC. OpenFL and Flambe are popular Haxe frameworks that enable the creation of multi-platform content from a single codebase."],"rdfs:label":["Haxe"],"key:en":["haxe"],"ns:common.topic.official_website":["<http://haxe.org/>"],"ns:base.schemastaging.context_name.pronunciation":[{"ns:base.schemastaging.pronunciation.yomigana":["ヘックス"],"rdf:type":["ns:base.schemastaging.pronunciation"]}],"ns:cvg.computer_game_engine.used_for_computer_games":["Stephen Karsch"],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bkf23l"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://haxe.org/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.0dbjtf"]}],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.text":["Haxe is a versatile open-source high-level multiplatform programming language described on its website as a \\\"universal language\\\".\\nIt can produce:\\nThe code can be produced entirely within the Haxe development environment, sometimes requiring Neko, by using a single and unmodified code-base when compiling from one target to the next.\\nDevelopment of Haxe was started on the 22nd of October, 2005.
