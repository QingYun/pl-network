DG Scripts are now part of the tbaMUD release which is the continuation of CircleMUD from a different Development Team.\\nWhile simple and quick to learn, DG is a complete programming language, and all the normal programming expression conventions such as 'if' and 'while' are available.\\nDG Scripts is based on the idea of the 'trigger' - a small program (script) which is called (run) as a consequence of a certain action. Triggers are normally attached to a mobile, object, or room (as of tbaMUD 3.58 they are also attachable to players themselves). Although this may sound restrictive, in practice this set up is limited only by the imagination, as the results of one trigger will often be used to trigger another.\\nThe player, of course, does not usually see the association between object and trigger, so the effects can seem intelligent or random,"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/1553794>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["DG scripts"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125bwr3xz"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
