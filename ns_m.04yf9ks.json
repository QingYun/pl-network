Type inference means that the need to explicitly write types down is minimised, while polymorphic records and functions, together with ad-hoc function overloading, allow easy writing of general functions.\\nKaya allows functions to be partially applied, with the remaining parameters completed later. This allows easy development of generalised functions, evaluation of expensive functions to be postponed until necessary, and separation of program code into logical chunks to be done without sacrificing efficiency. Anonymous functions (lambda functions) are also supported.\\nKaya includes extensive pattern matching capabilities, allowing analysis of complex data structures and extraction of needed variables to be expressed more readably than via a sequence of nested if statements. Complex data types may be aliased to type synonyms, to improve the readability of code, and to allow for implementation changes.\\nThere are several primitive types, including automatically sized"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/20058362>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://kayalang.org>"],"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bkwtkx"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.04yf9ks"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2004"],"ns:type.object.name":["Kaya"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1257dmjnw"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.03j_q"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
