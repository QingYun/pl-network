In Kyma, a user programs a multiprocessor DSP by graphically connecting modules on the screen of a Macintosh or Windows computer.\\nKyma has characteristics of both object-oriented and functional programming languages. The basic unit in Kyma is the \\\"Sound\\\" object, not the \\\"note\\\" of traditional music notation. A Sound is defined as:\\ni) a Sound atom\\nii) a unary transform T(s) where s is a Sound\\niii) an n-ary transform T(s1, s2,.., sn), where s1,s2,..sn are Sounds\\nA Sound atom is a source of audio (like a microphone input or a noise generator), a unary transform modifies its argument (for example, a LowpassFilter might take a running average of its input), and an n-ary transform combines two or more Sounds (a Mixer, for example, is defined as the sum of its inputs).\\nThe first version of Kyma, which computed digital audio samples on a Macintosh 512K was written in the Smalltalk programming language in 1986 by Carla Scaletti in Champaign, Illinois. In May 1987, Scaletti had partitioned Kyma into graphics and sound generation engines and ported the sound generation code to a digital"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/6219876>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Kyma"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12552m__v"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
