For all but a few minor incompatibilities, the SQL-89 standard is forward compatible with SQL-92.\\nThe standard specification itself grew about five times compared to SQL-89. Much of it was due more precise specifications of existing features; the increase due to new features was only by a factor of 1.5â€“2. Many of the new features had already been implemented by vendors before the new standard was adopted. However, most of the new features were added to the \\\"intermediate\\\" and \\\"full\\\" tiers of the specification, meaning that conformance with SQL-92 entry level was scarcely any more demanding than conformance with SQL-89.\\nLater revisions of the standard include SQL:1999, SQL:2003, SQL:2008, and SQL:2011."],"rdfs:label":["SQL-92"],"key:en":["sql-92"],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.text":["SQL-92 was the third revision of the SQL database query language.
