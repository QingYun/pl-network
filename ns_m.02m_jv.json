Many fundamental MUCK commands, in fact, are implemented as MUF programs, and built-in commands of the MUCK server are often replaced with more sophisticated versions written in MUF.\\nLike Forth, MUF is a stack-based, compilable, structured language. MUF programs are created by entering source code in an interactive MUF editor (a feature of the MUCK server) and compiling it into a \\\"program object\\\" â€” a referenceable object in the MUCK's database providing redirection to the executable code. Because the editor is relatively crude, most MUF programmers write source code in a text editor on a client machine and upload it into the editor.\\nThe language supports several primitive data types: strings, integers, floats, dictionaries, arrays, database references (usually referred to as dbrefs), and boolean locks. A string is a series of characters, used primarily to process input and output. Originally, MUCK supported only integer numbers, but support for"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/539194>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["MUF"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12590clz3"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.02z81"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.02z81"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05yd5"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.08yy56"]}}
