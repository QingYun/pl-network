The language is currently under development as an open source project by Christopher Bertels.\\nThe language has been in development since the beginning of 2010 and has changed from a C++-based interpreter to be running on Rubinius, a dynamic bytecode virtual machine and implementation for the Ruby programming language.. Thus Fancy supports seamless integration with Ruby and any Ruby libraries.\\nFancy is a dynamic programming language, meaning that it will execute tasks at runtime that many languages would perform during compilation. Fancy is a garbage-collected language, like Java or Ruby. The goals of Fancy as a programming language are to be easily understandable by programming beginners, and to perform well enough to be used as a scripting language in Unix environments.\\nFancy is implemented on top of Rubinius, the Ruby VM, and therefore integrates well with Ruby. Since Fancy is built on Ruby objects, the authors decided to allow access to the original Ruby classes by using a different syntax. For this reason, Fancy can be extended easily to use Ruby libraries, or any of the"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/30882174>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.fancy-lang.org>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.0fpgc8s"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2010"],"ns:type.object.name":["Fancy"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1yl5l7mqw"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.070d2"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"]}}
