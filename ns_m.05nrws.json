The primary difference between Moto and server-side scripting languages is that Moto pages can run interpreted (like PHP) or be natively compiled into dynamically loadable Apache modules (an entire Web site could be compiled into one .so file). Moto has a type checking phase so programmers see more errors up front. Programmers can define classes and functions in moto and make use of powerful exception handling.\\nMoto comes with a full suite of objects and functions for state and session management, MySQL and PostgreSQL database connectivity, and a large variety of utility classes. There is also an included interface definition language for exposing C functions to Moto. All object allocation occurs in a shared memory segment, so maintaining objects in memory between page views is a snap.\\nWhen building a public Web Site or Web Application , the ability to deliver page views quickly and cheaply matters a great deal. Web applications should be designed to be distributed among multiple servers. But one System Administrator can only manage so many different machines.
