{"ns:m.0wxwn0b":{"ns:common.topic.description":["The Wolfram Language is a general multi-paradigm programming language developed by Wolfram Research, that serves as the main interfacing language for Mathematica and the Wolfram Programming Cloud. It is designed to be as general as possible, with emphasis on symbolic computation, functional programming, and rule-based programming. It is built to represent arbitrary structures and data.\\nThe language is very large, touching on numerous domains, often specialized. For example, it includes built-in functions for generating and running Turing machines, creating graphics and audio, analyzing 3D models, and solving differential equations. It also has a large amount of documentation.\\nIt is bundled with the system software installed on every Raspberry Pi. Intel Edison, introduced at CES 2014, also integrates the language. The language will also be integrated in the Unity game engine."],"ns:common.topic.alias":["The Wolfram Language"],"rdfs:label":["Wolfram Language"],"key:dataworld.freeq":["job_fe78308a-a639-40d8-9a0f-68bd5c1305df_var_en_wikipedia_org_wiki_Wolfram_$0028programming_language$0029"],"ns:type.object.name":["Wolfram Language"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1yl5vfk6w"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05yd5"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.0j3djl7"]}}
