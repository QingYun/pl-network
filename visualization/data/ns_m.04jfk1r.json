Its primary design goal is to provide a standard library API that abstracts away the question of whether the code will ultimately run on the JRE or CLR. Like C# and Java, Fantom uses a curly brace syntax. The language supports functional programming through closures and concurrency through the Actor model.

The language supports functional programming through closures and concurrency through the Actor model. Fantom takes a \\\"middle of the road\\\" approach to its type system, blending together aspects of both static and dynamic typing. Like C# and Java, Fantom uses a curly brace syntax.\\nFantom's type system is simple by design. All variables are statically typed, as they are in C# and Java. Fantom rejects generic types due to their complexity, but it does have a set of built-in generic types: List, Map, and Func. Fantom can also take on the feel of a dynamically typed language through dynamic calls and automatic downcasting. Fantom has an easy to use reflection API and metaprogramming capabilities.\\nFantom is open source under the Academic Free License 3.0 and is available for Windows and Unix-like platforms (including Mac OS X)\\\". \\nIn Fantom, the unit of deployment is called a pod. Pods take on the role of namespaces, packages, and modules. They are stored as .pod files,"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/18969637>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bl6cyc"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.fantom.org/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.04jfk1r"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2007"],"ns:type.object.name":["Fantom"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1256pxlc4"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.01h1_2"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.091hdj"]}}
