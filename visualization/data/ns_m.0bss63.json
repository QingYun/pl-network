It is conceptually based upon a separate programming language called Karel.\\nThe Karel++ programming language was appropriately named after Czech writer, Karel Čapek (most commonly associated with contriving the common word, 'robot'). The 'plus plus' suffix of the title was presumably adapted from the popular object-oriented programming language, C++.\\nKarel the Robot, released in 1981, contains syntax and methodology copied from Pascal; whereas Karel++ provides a basis for the logistics of C++ and Java. In Karel the Robot, the programmer is provided with the fundamental problem solving medium, although in Karel++, the user has the ability to apply their problem solving skills with the construction of classes.\\nBecause Karel++ is an OOP language, a virtual world is provided for the user in order to physically see their code application.\\nThese robots inhabit a world lacking any sort of definite structure — it is simply a plain grid of horizontal \\\"streets\\\" and vertical \\\"avenues\\\" along which each robot can move.
