(now owned by Adobe Systems). It is a dialect of ECMAScript (meaning it is a superset of the syntax and semantics of the language more widely known as JavaScript), and is used primarily for the development of websites and software targeting the Adobe Flash Player platform, used on Web pages in the form of embedded SWF files. The language itself is open-source in that its specification is offered free of charge and both an open source compiler (as part of Adobe Flex) and open source virtual machine (Mozilla Tamarin) are available.\\nActionScript was initially designed for controlling simple 2D vector animations made in Adobe Flash (formerly Macromedia Flash). Initially focused on animation, early versions of Flash content offered few interactivity features and thus had very limited scripting capability. Later versions added functionality allowing for the creation of Web-based games and rich Internet applications with streaming media (such as video and audio). Today, ActionScript is suitable for use in some database applications, and in basic robotics, as with the Make Controller Kit.\\nFlash MX 2004"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/519691>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.description":["Adobe Flash"],"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj32"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0blf2nl"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.adobe.com/flash>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.02ky6z"]}],"ns:common.topic.image":[{"ns:type.content.length":["112743"],"rdfs:label":["Example of ActionScript 2.0 running on Macromedia Flash 8."],"ns:type.content.blob_id":["99966ffae5d92d077528a9b93d021fa5de543e663e5cb700231a95beaae06bdc"],"ns:type.content.source":["ns:m.0420gwj"],"ns:common.image.size":["ns:m.0kjmvg"],"ns:type.content.media_type":["ns:m.08y0"],"ns:type.object.name":["Example of ActionScript 2.0 running on Macromedia Flash 8."],"rdf:type":["ns:type.content"],"ns:common.image.appears_in_topic_gallery":["ns:m.02ky6z"],"ns:common.licensed_object.license":["ns:m.05smz"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["Gary Grossman"],"ns:book.book_subject.works":[{"rdfs:label":["Actionscript 3.0 Cookbook"],"ns:book.written_work.subjects":["ns:m.02ky6z"],"ns:book.written_work.author":[],"ns:book.book.editions":["ns:m.04ynggp"],"ns:type.object.name":["Actionscript 3.0 Cookbook"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.topic"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:book.book"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1259g2l96"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xryvm"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1998"],"ns:type.object.name":["ActionScript"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.software_genre"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1259s59r2"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.019syg"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.0gkc5"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.07sbkfb"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.0dbjtf"],"ns:computer.software_genre.software_in_genre":["ns:m.0gl0n4s"]}}
