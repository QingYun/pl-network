It is a rapid application development language, designed primarily for easy creation of computer game software but also includes tools that allow for application development. The syntax is based on the Pascal programming language and also allows the inclusion of Assembly Language routines.\\nBoth a 2D and 3D engine are implemented in the Cobra programming language. Each works independently of the other but both can be used simultaneously.\\nCobra3D is the current name for Cobra's 3D computer graphics engine component that uses an enhanced version of GLScene (a free 3D lib for Delphi). It utilizes OpenGL, and aims to take advantage of OpenGL's power and portability. In addition to basic 3D capabilities similar to other 3D engines, to simplify and speed up development of 3D games, Cobra's 3D Engine comes included with 3D special effects such as shadows, shaders, blurring, cel shading, and particles.\\nCobra's \\\"Pure2D\\\" library works independently of the 3D engine and actually requires no 3D acceleration or runtime libraries whatsoever (DirectX or OpenGL are not"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/6012510>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Cobra"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1256y3030"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.05z1_"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05yd5"]}}
