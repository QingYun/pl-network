{"ns:m.0j3djl7":{"ns:common.topic.description":["Julia is a high-level dynamic programming language designed to address the requirements of high-performance numerical and scientific computing while also being effective for general purpose programming, even web use or as a specification language. Distinctive aspects of Julia's design include having a type system with parametric types in a fully dynamic programming language, and adopting multiple dispatch as its core programming paradigm. It allows for parallel and distributed computing, and direct calling of C and Fortran libraries without glue code. Julia is garbage collected, uses eager evaluation, and includes efficient libraries for floating point, linear algebra, random number generation, fast Fourier transforms, and regular expression matching."],"rdfs:label":["Julia"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":[],"ns:base.schemastaging.context_name.pronunciation":[{"ns:base.schemastaging.pronunciation.yomigana":["ジュリア"],"rdf:type":["ns:base.schemastaging.pronunciation"]}],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/38455554>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://julialang.org/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.0j3djl7"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2012"],"ns:type.object.name":["Julia"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1yl5s8x0r"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0wxwn0b"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05yd5"]}}
