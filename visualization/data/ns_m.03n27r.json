F-Script is tagged as Cocoa developer's best friend, wherein the package provides an integrated set of tools that makes it possible to interactively explore and manipulate Cocoa objects as well as script them using new high-level programming techniques. F-Script is Smalltalk with support for array programming for Cocoa Objects.\\nF-Script is based on a pure object paradigm (every entity manipulated within the language is an object), its base syntax and concepts being identical to those of Smalltalk (the canonical example of the category) with specific extensions to support array programming as in the APL programming language.\\nF-Script provides an interpreted, interactive environment with support for workspaces, which provide a rich set of functionality including object persistence, distributed objects, GUI framework, database access, among other things.\\nLike Smalltalk, F-Script's syntax is very simple, without requiring specific notation for control structures which are provided in a unified manner by the message send operation.
