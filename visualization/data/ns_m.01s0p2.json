A functional computation consists of replacing subexpressions by equal (with regards to the function definitions) subexpressions until no more replacements (or reductions) are possible and a value or normal form is obtained. For instance, consider the function double defined by\\nThe expression “double 1” is replaced by 1+1. The latter can be replaced by 2 if we interpret the operator “+” to be defined by an infinite set of equations, e.g., 1+1 = 2, 1+2 = 3, etc. In a similar way, one can evaluate nested expressions (where the subexpression to be replaced are quoted):\\nThere is also another order of evaluation if we replace the arguments of operators from right to left:\\nIn this case, both derivations lead to the same result,"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/302187>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://curry-language.org/>"],"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bk36dm"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.01s0p2"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Curry"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1259918mk"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.04k52"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.03j_q"]}}
