ALCOR is an acronym, from ALGOL Converter.\\nIn addition, the naming of Alcor is an astronomical reference. Algol is named, in addition to its programming application, for the star Algol; In this way, Alcor is also named in astronomical reference for the star Alcor.\\nIn Europe, a high level machine architecture for ALGOL 60 was devised which was emulated on various real computers, among them the Siemens 2002 and the IBM 7090.
