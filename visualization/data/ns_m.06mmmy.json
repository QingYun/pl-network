The design goals of Ferite are to make a clean, cross-platform language which is easy to embed and easy to extend and provides support for existing and upcoming standards.\\nThe main influences for Ferite are: Java for objects, C and PHP for functions, Scheme for closures, Ruby for block calling, and C++ for namespaces. Ferite also features a sane loose typing mechanism and a small set of Application programming interfaces (APIs). Overall Ferite should be considered a curly-brace language.\\nBasic \\\"Hello World\\\" program:\\nUsing closures/lambda functions:\\nIterating through an array:\\nThese are just some of the beginners examples available."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/15313341>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2000"],"ns:type.object.name":["Ferite"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12571zrvr"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0jgqg"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"]}}
