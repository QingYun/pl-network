(Roedy originally planned to call it \\\"Enough\\\".)\\nOne unconventional feature of Abundance is the use of continuations to implement data entry form navigation, in a process known as \\\"jaunting\\\". Jaunting works by saving a continuation for every data field that the user enters, and restoring the associated continuation when a particular field needs to be made active.\\nThis approach allows complicated data validation rules to be written in a simple linear style, while allowing the user to jump between fields in a non-linear fashion."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/3674460>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1981"],"ns:type.object.name":["Abundance"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1258c06ll"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.02z81"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.03p3g9"]}}
