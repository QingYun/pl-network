Classes and Procedures are unified to one concept, a Pattern. Also, classes are defined as properties/attributes of objects. This means that a class cannot be instantiated without an explicit object context. A consequence of this is that BETA supports nested classes. Classes can be virtually defined, much like virtual methods can be in most object-oriented programming languages. Virtual entities (such as methods and classes) are never overwritten; instead they are redefined or specialized.\\nBETA supports the object-oriented perspective on programming and has comprehensive facilities for procedural and functional programming. It has powerful abstraction mechanisms to support identification of objects, classification and composition. BETA is a strongly typed language like Simula, Eiffel and C++, with most type checking done at compile-time. BETA aims to achieve an optimal balance between compile-time type checking and run-time type checking.\\nThis"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/135868>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://daimi.au.dk/~beta>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.010134"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["Kristen Nygaard"],"ns:type.object.name":["BETA"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12565w_w9"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.079l6"]}}
