Q is a thin wrapper around K, providing a more readable, English-like interface.\\nThe fundamental building blocks of Q are atoms, lists and functions. Atoms are scalars and include numeric, character and temporal data types. Lists are ordered collections of atoms (or other lists) upon which the higher level data structures dictionaries and tables are internally constructed. A dictionary is a map of a list of keys to a list of values. A table is a transposed dictionary of symbol keys and equal length lists (columns) as values. A keyed table, analogous to a table with a primary key placed on it, is a dictionary where the keys and values are arranged as two tables.\\nThe following code demonstrates the relationships of the data structures (expressions to be evaluated appear prefixed with the \\\"q)\\\" prompt, with the output of the evaluation shown beneath):\\nThese entities are manipulated via functions, which include the built-in functions"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/18595067>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["Arthur Whitney"],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2003"],"ns:type.object.name":["Q"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12561xyd9"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.03m62t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0q1d"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.0_1m8mq"]}}
