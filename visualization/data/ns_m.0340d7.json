It was originally created by Mark Overmars to supplement the drag-and-drop action system used in Game Maker. However, in the latest versions, all the drag-and-drop actions translate to GML rather than being separate from it.\\nGML is heavily integrated with the Game Maker environment. Usually, elements such as sprites and sounds are all organized within the Game Maker IDE (though they can also be loaded from external files). Game Maker's architecture is designed to handle such things as event detection, level design, and object configuration without the need to code them manually, minimizing code verbosity with intuitive interface features.\\nIn Game Maker, a set of drag-and-drop actions is called a library. In the Game Maker interface, these libraries are displayed as tabs containing icons called actions. Each action is a GML script or function that users can use in their games. Game Maker comes with a default set of libraries that contain the common actions used by most games; it is also possible to create libraries using the Library builder provided"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/702075>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://yoyogames.com/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.0340d7"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Game Maker Language"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1256mrvqj"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.02yjg_"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
