Therefore, one does not write a program in FCL, but one may write part of it in FCL.\\nFCL allows the programmer to specify fuzzy sets, which are lists of points on a graph, as well as IF-THEN rules, for example:\\nFCL is not an entirely complete fuzzy language, for instance, it does not support \\\"hedges\\\", which are adverbs that modify the set. For instance, the programmer cannot write:\\nHowever, the programmer can simply define new sets for \\\"very cold\\\" and \\\"very high\\\".
