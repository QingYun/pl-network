On classic Psion PDAs such as the Series 3, 5/5mx, Series 7, and netBook/netPad, as well as the MC218, OPL is part of the standard application suite. OPL is also included in Psion Teklogix industrial handhelds such as the Workabout mx. OPL is an interpreted language similar to BASIC. A fully Visual Basic-compatible language OVAL has been also developed.\\nThe language was originally called Organiser Programming Language developed by Psion Ltd for the Psion Organiser. The first implementation (without graphics) was for the original Psion Organiser (now referred to as the Psion Organiser I, 1984) and came bundled with the Science, Finance and Math datapaks. It became truly accessible as built in software in the Psion Organiser II (1986) and the language went on to be used in the Psion Series 3 and later. After Psion retired from the PDA market, the project was changed to open source"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/832032>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bkq_5t"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://opl-dev.sourceforge.net>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.03fjx0"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1984"],"ns:type.object.name":["Open Programming Language"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1257lwzby"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.06w_b"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
