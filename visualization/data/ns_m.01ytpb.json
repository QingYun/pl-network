The most recent major release (3.5) was released in March 2012.\\nStarting with version 3, the SuperCollider environment has been split into two components: a server, scsynth; and a client, sclang. These components communicate using OSC (Open Sound Control).\\nSC Language combines the object oriented structure of Smalltalk and features from functional programming languages with a C family syntax.\\nThe SC Server application supports a simple C plugin API making it easy to write efficient sound algorithms (unit generators), which can then be combined into graphs of calculations. Because all external control in the server happens via OSC, it is possible to"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/346978>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bkc4r_"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.01ytpb"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["SuperCollider"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125gpgkny"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0jp72"]}}
