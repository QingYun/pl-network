It has an interpreter developed in Smalltalk, which recognizes its own dialect of the BASIC programming language. It runs on 16- and 32-bit Windows and OS/2.\\nLiberty BASIC was written by Carl Gundel and published in its first release by his company, Shoptalk Systems, in 1992. It has progressed steadily since then. The last published update to the software was in 2006. The current version is v4.04. Liberty BASIC has been used in examples of code for various guides and references about programming in Windows, including \\\"Beginning Programming For Dummies\\\", by Wallace Wang.\\nThough Liberty BASIC has its share of limitations in its design for advanced programming, it makes a credible and very usable introductory integrated development environment, IDE, for moderate to advanced users of Windows and OS/2. DLLs are available with functions allowing users to overcome most of the limitations in Liberty BASIC. The OS/2 version is very old, but free. A new version that will run on Windows, Macintosh and Linux is in active development.\\nThe Liberty BASIC dialect, and IDE, have developed"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/53252>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.developers":["Carl Gundel"],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1992"],"ns:type.object.name":["Liberty BASIC"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125d9brwm"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.02r5chy"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.0gxhd"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0h22q"]}}
