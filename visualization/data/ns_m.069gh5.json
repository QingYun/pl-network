It later moved to Windows 3.0, where version 1.3 was released on CompuServe around 1993, then became available as a Windows GUI graphics-capable application and a DOS console application (both 16-bit). In 1995, with the release of Windows 95, newLISP moved to 32-bit.\\nIn April 1999, newLISP was ported to Linux; some of its core algorithms were rewritten, and all Windows-specific code eliminated. NewLISP was released as an Open Source project licensed under the GPL, and development on Windows stopped after version 6.0.25. During the first half of 2001, newLISP was ported back to Windows on the Cygwin platform without graphics capabilities. A multi-platform Tcl/Tk frontend named newLISP-tk was released around version 6.3.0, during the second half of 2001. 64-bit precision was introduced for integer arithmetic and for some operations on files in version 9.0 in 2006.\\nSince the release of 6.5 in mid 2002, development has been very active, and"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/1964813>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1991"],"ns:type.object.name":["newLISP"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12582gfxf"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.01tlw"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.04kyw"]}}
