This technique is preferable to writing a so-called plug-in module using a traditional language such as C for a number of reasons, among them:\\nThere are several different aspects of CINEMA 4D's operation that can be customised using COFFEE scripts, notably additions to the user interface and extensions for reading and writing new file formats and creating texture shaders. Almost all the main functionality of the application can be accessed from a COFFEE program, and so customised features can look and behave much like those supplied as standard.\\nCOFFEE is a fairly typical curly bracket language and so it would look familiar to any previous user of C/C++, Java, Perl or anything along those lines.
