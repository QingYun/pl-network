The manufacturers and licensors of the operating systems usually supply a C++ based tool aimed at highly skilled professional developers. NS BASIC provides an alternative using the Basic programming language, similar to Visual Basic. Key developers include George Henne, Marcus Darden, James Kruth, Eric Pepke and Dan Rowley.\\nAs of 2012, NS Basic's tools are used by almost 20,000 developers in over 80 countries.\\nNS Basic/App Studio was released in December, 2010. It consists of an IDE, a programming language and a deploy module. The IDE and programming language are modeled on Microsoft's Visual Basic: virtually the entire VBscript syntax is implemented. The runtime environment is based on JavaScript, HTML5 and WebKit: many of the features of the underlying technologies is exposed to the NS Basic/App Studio environment."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/19160625>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.nsbasic.com>"],"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bllqd3"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.04lgm_f"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["NS Basic"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125c0gh0p"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
