Davis to provide extensibility to C-based applications in the form of an embedded interpreter. Created in 1992, its original syntax reflected its origins as a stack-oriented language, but the current syntax has evolved to more closely resemble that of C. S-Lang is small, simple, and dynamically typed, with strong support for numerical array-based operations. Because of its size and ease-of-embedding, S-Lang has been embedded in non-numerical programs such as the slrn newsreader and the JED text editor.\\nSeveral aspects of the language are illustrated by the following example. These include support for array-based arithmetic, function qualifiers, and object-oriented style method calls. The example makes use of the Grace plotting module to plot an exponentially damped sine curve with overplotted points from a file:"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/923900>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bjp16v"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.jedsoft.org/slang>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.01zzd8"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1992"],"ns:type.object.name":["S-Lang"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125bl_s00"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05yd5"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.01t6b"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
