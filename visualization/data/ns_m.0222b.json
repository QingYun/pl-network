Coral 66 was subsequently developed by I. F. Currie and M. Griffiths under the auspices of IECCA (Inter-Establishment Commitee for Computer Applications). Its official definition, edited by Woodward, Wetherall and Gorman, was first published in 1970.\\nCoral 66 is a general-purpose programming language based on ALGOL 60, with some features from Coral 64, JOVIAL, and FORTRAN. It includes structured record types (as in Pascal) and supports the packing of data into limited storage (also as in Pascal). Like Edinburgh IMP it allows embedded assembler, and also offers good run-time checking and diagnostics. It is specifically intended for real-time and embedded applications and for use on computers with limited processing power, including those limited to fixed point arithmetic and those without support for dynamic storage allocation.\\nThe language was an inter-service standard for British military programming, and was also widely adopted for civil purposes in the British control and automation industry."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/7262>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1964"],"ns:type.object.name":["Coral 66"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1258jtjsx"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.06w_b"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0q1x"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
