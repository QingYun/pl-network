It has explicit support for top-down programming. Statement nesting is indicated by indentation. It provides infinite precision arithmetic, unlimited sized lists and strings, and other features supporting orthogonality and ease of use by novices. Its designers claim that ABC programs are typically around a quarter the size of the equivalent Pascal or C programs, and more readable.\\nABC was originally a monolithic implementation, leading to an inability to adapt to new requirements, such as creating a Graphical User Interface. ABC could not directly access the underlying file system and operating system.\\nABC includes a programming environment with syntax-directed editing, suggestions, persistent variables, and multiple workspaces.\\nABC is"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/147585>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.developers":["Guido van Rossum"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["Lambert Meertens"],"ns:type.object.name":["ABC"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125dx7g11"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.06w_b"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.03ppzh"],"ns:computer.programming_language.dialects":["ns:m.05z1_"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.05z1_"]}}
