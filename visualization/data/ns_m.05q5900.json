It takes a dynamic stock and flow approach to modeling in which stocks act as reservoirs that store a material and flows transfer materials between stocks. An emphasis on communication and understandability is placed on the models developed by Simgua. Simgua models are constructed from a variety of ten basic objects known as 'primitives' (of which stocks and flows are two). Primitives are assigned properties such as the rate of flow for flow primitives. Equations may be entered using elementary mathematics or Visual Basic code.\\nIn addition to primitives, Simgua supports what it calls 'components.' Components are redistributable collections of primitives and Visual Basic code that can be used to model standardized processes and then be shared amongst users. Simgua comes with a set of components design to model Wastewater Treatment Plants. The results of a Simgua simulation is a time-based series of data containing the changing state of the model over the course of the simulation.\\nThe first version of Simgua was released for the Macintosh in May 2008.
