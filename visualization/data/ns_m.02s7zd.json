Coq works within the theory of the calculus of inductive constructions, a derivative of the calculus of constructions. Coq is not an automated theorem prover but includes automatic theorem proving tactics and various decision procedures.\\nCoq implements a dependently typed functional programming language.\\nIt is developed in France, in the TypiCal (ex-LogiCal) project, jointly operated by INRIA, École Polytechnique, Paris-Sud 11 University and CNRS. There was also formerly a group at École Normale Supérieure de Lyon. The team leader is Senior Scientist Benjamin Werner. Coq is implemented in OCaml.\\nThe word coq means \\\"cock\\\" or \\\"rooster\\\" in French, and stems from a tradition of naming French research development tools with animal names. It is also a reference to Thierry Coquand, who developed the aforementioned calculus of constructions along with Gérard Huet.
