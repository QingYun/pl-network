The acronym stood for File-Oriented Interpretive Language and it was very similar to other CAI languages like COURSEWRITER and PILOT. However, it tried to make the language somewhat block-structured using whitespace which ended up making the language vaguely similar to BASIC or ABC.\\nThe second FOIL was a music generation language for the Touché computer instrument in 1979. The Touché was a keyboard that had digital tone generation and allowed you to program software for performances. The acronym stood for Far Out Instrument Language and was succeeded by MetaFOIL and FOIL-83. The language was developed by David Rosenbloom and was based on Forth."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/602746>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["FOIL"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1256dx33t"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
