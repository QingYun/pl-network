AMOS BASIC was published by Europress Software and originally written by François Lionet with Constantin Sotiropoulos.\\nAMOS is a descendant of STOS BASIC for the Atari ST. AMOS BASIC was first produced in 1990.\\nAMOS competed on the Amiga platform with Acid Software's Blitz BASIC. Both BASICs differed from other dialects on different platforms, in that they allowed the easy creation of fairly demanding multimedia software, with full structured code and many high-level functions to load images, animations, sounds and display them in various ways.\\nThe original AMOS version was interpreted which, whilst working fine, suffered from performance problems. Later, an AMOS compiler was developed that reduced this problem.\\nTo speed up the animation of sprites, AMOS included the AMOS Animation Language (AMAL), a compiled sprite scripting language which runs independently of the main AMOS BASIC program. It was also possible to control screen and \\\"rainbow\\\" effects using AMAL scripts.\\nAfter the original version of AMOS, Europress released two other versions: Easy AMOS, a simpler version for beginners, and"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/2957>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0blpcb8"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.clickteam.com/eng/downloadcenter.php?i=58>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.012gr"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1990"],"ns:type.object.name":["AMOS"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1255bdt8c"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05yd5"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.04x1xl"]}}
