It is similar in many ways to the scripting languages used by ircII and mIRC, as well as Tcl and C.\\nThe name \\\"Versus\\\" was chosen because it could be shortened to \\\"VS\\\", which was a common abbreviation for ViRCScript, the language used by Visual IRC '96 through '98. Versus remained mostly backward compatible with ViRCScript, so existing documentation and commentary that mentioned \\\"VS\\\" remained mostly accurate when applied to Versus. The name also alluded to BIRC's origins as a replacement for ViRC.\\nObject Versus, or OVS, refers to the object-oriented features of Versus. Scripts can define classes and work with objects and methods instead of textual data and aliases; however, in practice, OVS is mostly used to manipulate the VCL objects that make up ViRC's interface.\\nScripts are stored in files, usually with a .vsc file extension, though the .lib extension is sometimes used. A Versus script file simply contains statements to be interpreted when the script is loaded; any blocks defined in a script (see below) will replace blocks defined with the same name by previous"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/2246436>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Versus programming language"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125bpyr07"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
