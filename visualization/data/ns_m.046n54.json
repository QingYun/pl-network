The compilation is guided by a \\\"pointer\\\" that moves around the image, from one continuous coloured region to the next. Procedures are carried through when the pointer exits a region.\\nThere are 20 colours for which behaviour is specified: 18 \\\"colourful\\\" colours, which are ordered by a 6-step hue cycle and a 3-step brightness cycle; and black and white which are not ordered. When exiting a \\\"colourful\\\" colour and entering another one, the performed procedure is determined by the number of steps of change in hue and brightness. Black cannot be entered; when the pointer tries to enter a black region, the rules of choosing the next block are changed instead. If all possible rules are tried, the program terminates. Regions outside the borders of the image are also treated as black. White does not perform operations, but allows the pointer to \\\"pass through\\\". The behaviour of colours other than the 20 specified is left to the compiler.\\nVariables are stored in memory as signed integers in a single stack. Most specified procedures deal with operations on that stack,"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/1107826>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Piet"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1257bh3_0"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
