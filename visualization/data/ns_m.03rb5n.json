{"ns:m.03rb5n":{"ns:common.topic.description":["APLX is a cross-platform dialect of the APL programming language. APLX is targeted at applications such as financial planning, market research, statistics, management information, and various kinds of scientific and engineering work. APLX is based on IBM's APL2, but includes a number of extensions. APLX is created by MicroAPL. Version 3 of APLX was released in April and May 2005. It is available on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. Though APLX keeps APL's extended character set, APLX is a bit more verbose, due to the prevalence of system functions with long names and the use of structured-control keywords. The use of explicit loops is a major deviation from earlier versions of APL, as well as other APL derivatives.\\nOther extensions include:\\nObject-oriented programming\\nSupport for .NET, ActiveX, operating system resources & connectivity\\nXML-array conversion primitives"],"rdfs:label":["APLX"],"key:en":["aplx"],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.text":["APLX is a modern, second generation, cross-platform dialect of the APL programming language.
