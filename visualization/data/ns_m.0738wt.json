The initials stand for Low-level INterfaced OverLanguage for Extremely Universal Machine-coding. The L.in.oleum programming language (hereafter referred to as Lino) is easier to learn than assembly languages. The Lino assembler is designed to assemble executable code for different central processing units (CPU) without needing changes to the source code.\\nLino is intended for writing general-purpose programs, especially when portability, execution speed, and module size are critical to the application's success. These traits are especially important in fields of study that demand performance-intensive programs. Examples of such fields (in which Lino is actually being used) include fractals, mathematics (such as an implementation of fast Fourier transform), and ray tracing, to name a few.\\nThis increased performance is achieved by Lino's nearly one-to-one ratio between Lino instructions and CPU instructions. That is, most instructions in Lino can be executed in one"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/32676730>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Linoleum"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1255xlh_p"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05yd5"]}}
