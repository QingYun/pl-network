Its development, started in 1986, was directed by Vladimir Parondzhanov. The goal was to replace specialised languages PROL2 (ПРОЛ2), DIPOL (ДИПОЛЬ) and LAKS (ЛАКС) used in the Buran project with one universal language.\\nThe work was finished in 1996 (3 years after the Buran project was officially closed), when an automated CASE programming system called \\\"Grafit-Floks\\\" was developed.\\nAfter that it was used in Sea Launch and other space projects.\\nDRAKON rules for creating diagrams are cognitively optimised for easy comprehension, making it a tool for intelligence augmentation."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/9912359>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.image":[{"ns:type.content.length":["51520"],"rdfs:label":["A DRAKON diagram describing a transportation of a cryonics patient"],"ns:type.content.blob_id":["eb72e723a174a88b0f164256341fd92b581e9a4cd2f7a1790e98271a2e8d3075"],"ns:common.image.size":["ns:m.03v090h"],"ns:type.content.source":["ns:m.03v0913"],"ns:common.licensed_object.license":["ns:m.05smz"],"ns:type.content.media_type":["ns:m.08y0"],"ns:type.object.name":["A DRAKON diagram describing a transportation of a cryonics patient"],"rdf:type":["ns:type.content"],"ns:common.image.appears_in_topic_gallery":["ns:m.02pwtvp"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["DRAKON"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1259t_y2x"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
