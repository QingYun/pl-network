It was created by Sun Microsystems with funding from DARPA's High Productivity Computing Systems project. One of the language designers is Guy L. Steele Jr., whose previous work includes Scheme, Common Lisp, and Java.\\nThe name \\\"Fortress\\\" is intended to connote a secure Fortran, i.e., \\\"a language for high-performance computation that provides abstraction and type safety on par with modern programming language principles\\\". Its improvements include implicit parallelism, Unicode support and concrete syntax that is similar to mathematical notation. The language is not designed to be similar to Fortran. Syntactically, it most resembles Scala, Standard ML, and Haskell. Fortress is being designed from the outset to have multiple syntactic stylesheets. Source code can be rendered as ASCII text, in Unicode, or as a prettied image. This will allow for support of mathematical symbols and other symbols in the rendered output for easier reading.\\nFortress is also designed to be both highly parallel and have rich functionality contained within libraries, drawing from Java but taken to a higher degree.
