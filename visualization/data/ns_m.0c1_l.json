Thus, rather than describing the outline of the glyph directly, a Metafont file describes the pen paths. Some simpler Metafont fonts, such as the calligraphic mathematics fonts in the Computer Modern family, use a single pen stroke with a relatively large pen to define each visual \\\"stroke\\\" of the glyphs. More complex fonts such as the Roman text fonts in the Computer Modern family use a small pen to trace around the outline of the visual \\\"strokes\\\", which are then filled; the result is much like an outline font,"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/44263>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Metafont"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1256h666m"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.01q7b0"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
