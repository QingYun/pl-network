Created by GraphLogic, PointDragon is the first implementation of Object Process Graph technology.\\nAs an implementation of Object Process Graph (OPG) technology, PointDragon is an integrated development and computing platform that fuses all aspects of an application: Program, Database, and User Interface.  Pointdragon programming components are divided between nodes, either composite or primitive, and edges, actions that define the relationships between nodes. Utilizing a general-purpose graph structure, PointDragon is a completely virtual programming environment for cloud computing. Primarily in use within the Life Sciences, applications built using PointDragon have included scientific data management systems such as LIMS and LIS, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and HR. Similar in appearance and application to LabVIEW, PointDragon differs in that it is a general-purpose programming environment and is built upon fundamentally novel Object Process Graph Technology.\\nThe PointDragon visual"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/19989755>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bl6dzp"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.graphlogic.com/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.04ycygx"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["PointDragon"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1256np713"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
