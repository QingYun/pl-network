To this end, Cyclone places the following limits on programs:\\nTo maintain the tool set that C programmers are used to, Cyclone provides the following extensions:\\nFor a better high-level introduction to Cyclone, the reasoning behind Cyclone and the source of these lists, see this paper.\\nCyclone looks, in general, much like C, but it should be viewed as a C-like language.\\nCyclone implements three kinds of reference (following C terminology these are called pointers):\\nThe purpose of introducing these new pointer types is to avoid common problems when using pointers.
