{"ns:m.04pzdj":{"ns:common.topic.description":["F is a module-oriented, compiled and numeric computer programming language. F is designed for scientific programming and scientific computation. F was developed by the Fortran Company and was developed as a modern Fortran thus making it a subset of Fortran 95 and Fortran 90 programming language. It combines both numerical features and data abstraction features from these languages.F is also backwards compatibility thus allowing to make calls to Fortran 77 program. F uses the g95 compiler, which is the same compiler used for Fortran 95. F compilers are readily available on both Windows and various Linux Operating Systems free of charge or can be as part of a bundle from the Fortran Store."],"rdfs:label":["F"],"key:en":["f_programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.text":["F is a compiled, structured, array programming language especially well suited to education and scientific computing.
