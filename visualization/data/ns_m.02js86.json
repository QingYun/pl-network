Groovy uses a Java-like curly-bracket syntax. Most Java code is also syntactically valid Groovy, although semantics may be different.\\nGroovy 1.0 was released on January 2, 2007, and Groovy 2.0 in July, 2012. Groovy 3.0 is planned for release in late 2015, with support for a new Meta Object Protocol. Since version 2, Groovy can also be compiled statically, offering type inference and performance very close to that of Java. Groovy 2.4 was the last major release under Pivotal Software's sponsorship which ended in March 2015."],"rdfs:label":["Groovy"],"key:en":["groovy"],"key:base.ranker.rankerurlname":["groovy$002F1106300"],"ns:common.topic.official_website":["<http://groovy.codehaus.org/>"],"ns:common.topic.social_media_presence":["<http://plus.google.com/101432359761228268146>"],"ns:computer.programming_language.developers":["Guillaume Laforge"],"ns:common.topic.subject_of":["Edward Beckett"],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.text":["Groovy is an object-oriented programming language for the Java platform.

Several versions were released between 2004 and 2006. After the JCP standardization process began, the version numbering was changed and a version called \\\"1.0\\\" was released on January 2, 2007. After various betas and release candidates numbered 1.1, on December 7, 2007, Groovy 1.1 Final was released and immediately rebranded as Groovy 1.5 as a reflection of the many changes that were made.\\nIn July 2009, Strachan wrote on his blog that \\\"I can honestly say if someone had shown me the Programming in Scala book by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon & Bill Venners back in 2003 I'd probably have never created Groovy.\\\" Strachan left the"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/508401>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bkm_d_"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://groovy.codehaus.org/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.02js86"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2003"],"ns:type.object.name":["Groovy"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12552m7c1"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.07sbkfb"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.07sbkfb"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.0k9hf94"]}}
