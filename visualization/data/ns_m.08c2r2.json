The name Fril was originally an acronym for Fuzzy Relational Inference Language.\\nAside from the uncertainty-management features of Fril, there are some minor differences in Fril's implementation of standard Prolog features.\\nThe basic types in Fril are similar to those in Prolog, with one important exception: Prolog's compound data type is the term, with lists defined as nested terms using the . functor; in Fril, the compound type is the list itself, which forms the basis for most constructs. Variables are distinguished by identifiers containing only uppercase letters and underscores (whereas Prolog only requires the first character to be uppercase).
