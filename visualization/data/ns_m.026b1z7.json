The language is based on F-logic and the theory of stratified logic programs. The engine is an Eclipse plug-in for the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).\\nTefkat was one of the sub-projects of the Pegamento project at the Distributed Systems Technology Centre (DSTC), Australia. Although the project was already underway, the most active research occurred for the submission of a response to the OMG's MOF 2.0 Queries / Views / Transformations Request for Proposals.\\nTefkat was open-sourced before the closure of the DSTC in June 2006, and is still under active development.\\nTefkat defines a mapping from a set of source metamodels to a set of target metamodels. A Tefkat transformation consists of rules, patterns and templates. Rules contain a source term and a target term. Patterns are simply named composite source terms, and templates are simply named composite target terms. These elements are based on F-logic and pure logic programming, however the absence of function symbols means a significant reduction in complexity.\\nTefkat has two more significant language elements: trackings and injections. Trackings allow"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/7726497>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Tefkat"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125dlsskz"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
