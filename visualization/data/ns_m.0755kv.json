Its environment includes an interpreter and a code editor along with a dialog designer and optional compiler to create self-contained executables.\\nIt is a reasonably easy language to learn, and its structure and syntax at first glance look a little like a cross between Basic and C. It has been continually developed over the years with many functions added along with support for things like ActiveX controls, COM (OLE), Unicode, UAC and code signing for Vista and Windows 7 etc.\\nWilson WindowWare was founded in 1989 with the product Command Post.\\nIn 1991, the menuing language in Command Post became WinBatch. Shortly after that, a corporate version was released which included a code binder (a program that combines a bytecode version of a program along with an interpreter).\\nDocumentation is available in German, Spanish and Japanese languages.\\nHere is the Winbatch Hello World program:\\nExtenders add additional commands to the WinBatch programming language. A few popular extenders are included with the default WinBatch installer, with additional extenders available for download."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/2343156>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Winbatch"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125b02l3c"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
