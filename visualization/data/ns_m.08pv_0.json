Date and Hugh Darwen believe a relational database query language ought to be like. It is proposed in their book The Third Manifesto.\\nD by itself is an abstract language specification. It does not specify language syntax. Instead, it specifies desirable and undesirable language characteristics in terms of prescriptions and proscriptions. Thus, D is not a language but a family of both implemented and future languages. A \\\"valid D\\\" must have a certain set of features, and exclude a different set of features which Date and Darwen consider unwise. A valid D may have additional features which are outside the scope of relational databases.\\nTutorial D is a specific D which is defined and used for illustration in The Third Manifesto. Implementations of D need not have the same syntax as Tutorial D. The purpose of Tutorial D is both educational and to show what a D might be like. Rel is an implementation of Tutorial D.\\nDâ€™s first implementation is D4, written in C#. D4 is the flagship language of Alphora's Dataphor. Others include Rel (see above), Opus, Duro, and Dee."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/3077431>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["D"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1257lx9z5"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
