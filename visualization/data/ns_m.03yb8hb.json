It is a functional general-purpose language. Clojure time-handling constructs simplify multithreaded programming.\\nClojure runs on the Java Virtual Machine, Common Language Runtime, and JavaScript engines. Like other Lisps, Clojure treats code as data and has a sophisticated macro system.\\nRich Hickey is the creator of the Clojure programming language. Before Clojure, he developed dotLisp, a similar project based on the .NET platform. Hickey spent about 2Â½ years working on Clojure before releasing it to the world, much of that time working exclusively on Clojure without external funding. At the end of this period Hickey sent an email announcing the language to some friends in the Common Lisp community.\\nHickey developed Clojure because he wanted a modern Lisp for functional programming, symbiotic with the established Java platform, and designed for concurrency.\\nClojure's approach to concurrency is characterized by the concept of identities, which represent a series of immutable states over time. Since states are immutable values, any number of workers can operate on them in"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/16561990>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://clojure.org>"],"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bjkld0"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.03yb8hb"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.developers":["Rich Hickey"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["Rich Hickey"],"ns:common.topic.image":[{"ns:type.content.length":["8980379"],"ns:common.image.rights_holder_text_attribution":["Attributed to flickr user Tapestry Dude"],"rdfs:label":["Rich Hickey"],"ns:type.content.blob_id":["a3612e5ded277e78b8fc376b389a279993149627acae329d2f132224f29fbd8c"],"ns:type.content.uploaded_by":["ns:m.0220tm0"],"ns:common.licensed_object.license":["ns:m.03mtr_r"],"ns:type.content.language":["ns:m.04l"],"ns:type.content.media_type":["ns:m.08x8"],"ns:common.image.size":["ns:m.0cmmxl2"],"ns:type.content.source":["ns:m.0cmmxlk"],"ns:type.object.name":["Rich Hickey"],"rdf:type":["ns:type.content"],"ns:common.image.appears_in_topic_gallery":["ns:m.058fmbt"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2007"],"ns:type.object.name":["Clojure"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1255whjc3"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.0pl075p"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.07phw8"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0974fb"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.04kyw"]}}
