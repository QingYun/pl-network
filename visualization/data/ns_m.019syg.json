The language is widely used for client-side scripting on the web, in the form of several well-known dialects such as JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript.\\nJavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape under the name Mocha, later LiveScript, and finally renamed to JavaScript. In December 1995, Sun Microsystems and Netscape announced JavaScript in a press release. In March 1996, Netscape Navigator 2.0 was released, featuring support for JavaScript.\\nDue to the widespread success of JavaScript as a client-side scripting language for web pages, Microsoft developed a compatible dialect of the language, naming it JScript to avoid trademark issues. JScript added new date methods to fix the non-Y2K-friendly methods in JavaScript, which were based on the Java Date class. JScript was included in Internet Explorer 3.0, released in August 1996.\\nNetscape delivered JavaScript to Ecma International for standardization and the work on the specification, ECMA-262, began in November 1996. The first edition of ECMA-262 was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/188515>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.description":["ECMAScript 4 Reference Implementation"],"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj32"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0blqh8z"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.ecmascript-lang.org/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.019syg"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.developers":["Sun Microsystems"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["Brendan Eich"],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1997"],"ns:type.object.name":["ECMAScript"],"rdf:type":["ns:user.doconnor.industry_standards.standard"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:computer.programming_language.dialects":["ns:m.05z3dws"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1259l_7hv"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.0gkc5"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0q2c"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.02p97"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.05p8z6f"]}}
