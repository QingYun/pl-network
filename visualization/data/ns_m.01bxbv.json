Its event dispatcher is based on Python’s generators and can also be used for asynchronous networking or to implement multi-agent systems.\\nProcesses in SimPy are simple Python generator functions and are used to model active components like customers, vehicles or agents. SimPy also provides various types of shared resources to model limited capacity congestion points. From version 3.1, it will also provide monitoring capabilities to aid in gathering statistics about resources and processes.\\nSimulations can be performed “as fast as possible”, in real time or by manually stepping through the events.\\nThough it is theoretically possible to do continuous simulations with SimPy, it has no features that help you with that. On the other hand, SimPy is overkill for simulations with a fixed step size where your processes don’t interact with each other or with shared resources — use a simple while loop in this case.\\nThe SimPy distribution contains tutorials, in-depth documentation, and a large number of examples."],"rdfs:label":["SimPy"],"key:en":["simpy"],"ns:common.topic.social_media_presence":["<http://plus.google.com/101634625602509193865>"],"ns:common.topic.official_website":["<http://simpy.sourceforge.net/>"],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.text":["SimPy is a free process-based, object-oriented discrete-event simulation language in Python. It provides the modeller with components for building a simulation model including Processes, for active entities like customers, messages, and vehicles, and Resources, for passive components that form limited capacity congestion points like servers, checkout counters, and tunnels. There are two varieties of Buffer classes, Levels to hold stored quantities and Stores to hold sets of objects. It has commands to aid interaction between entities. It provides Monitor and Tally objects to aid in gathering statistics and uses the standard Python random module to generate random variates.\\nIt is implemented in standard Python, 2.x and 3.x and is released as open source software under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). SimPy is platform-independent. It simulates parallel processes by an efficient implementation of coroutines using Python's generators capability.
