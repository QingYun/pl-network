The IDE provides code generation facilities via a system of templates which allow programmers to describe the program from an abstract level higher than actual code statements. The generator then turns this higher level into code, which in turn is then compiled and linked using a normal compiler and linker. This generation layer is sometimes referred to as 4GL programming.\\nThe generation layer is not required. It is possible to create programs completely at the code level, bypassing all the code generation facilities."],"rdfs:label":["Clarion"],"key:en":["clarion_programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.official_website":["<http://www.softvelocity.com/>"],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.text":["Clarion is a commercial, 4GL, multi-paradigm, programming language and Integrated Development Environment from SoftVelocity used to program database applications.

An \\\"embeditor\\\" shows the developer the code that will be generated and embed points where the developer can enter their own hand-code in the context of the template generated code. Advanced Clarion programmers can create their own templates, or edit the existing ones.\\nClarion is historically notable as being one of the first computer languages for MS-DOS that"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/508614>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.softvelocity.com>"],"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bkwmtb"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.02jt1_"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Clarion"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125529gwf"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.0gh89bk"]}}
