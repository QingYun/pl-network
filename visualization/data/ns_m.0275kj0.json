A GUI oriented software development platform which is written for Windows XP. This compiler converts the Spin code into bytecodes that can be loaded, (with the same tool) into the main 32KB RAM, (and optionally into the serial boot FLASH EEPROM) of the Propeller chip. After booting the propeller a bytecode interpreter is copied from the built in ROM into the 2K RAM of the primary COG. And then this COG will start interpreting the bytecodes in the main 32KB RAM.\\nMore than one copy of the bytecode interpreter can run in other COGs, so several Spin code threads can run simultaneously.\\nWithin a the general Spin code program assembler code program(s) can be \\\"inline\\\" inserted. These assembler program(s) will then run on their own COG's.\\nJust like Python Spin uses indentation/whitespace, rather than curly braces or keywords, to delimit statement blocks.\\nThe syntax of Spin can be broken down into blocks.
