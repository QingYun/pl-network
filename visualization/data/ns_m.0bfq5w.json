Primary influences include Seymour Papert and the Logo programming language, a dialect of Lisp optimized for educational use; work done at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, PARC; Smalltalk, HyperCard, and StarLogo (cf. ). Scott Wallace is the main author . Promotion and development of the main Squeak version of Etoys is co-ordinated by the Viewpoints Research Institute, a U.S. educational non-profit.\\nEtoys was a major influence on a similar Squeak-based programming environment known as Scratch. Scratch was designed with Etoys code in the early 21st century by the MIT Media Lab, initially targeted at after-school computer clubs.\\nThe Etoys system is based on the idea of programmable virtual entities behaving on the computer screen.\\nEtoys provides a media-rich authoring environment with"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/4052771>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["Alan Kay"],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1996"],"ns:type.object.name":["Etoys"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1257k7115"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.0gkc5"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.028167f"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0gzx5x"]}}
