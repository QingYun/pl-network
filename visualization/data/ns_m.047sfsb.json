For tertiary level teaching, however, Logo has been superseded by Scheme, and scripting languages."],"key:en":["ucblogo"],"ns:common.topic.official_website":["<http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/logo.html>"],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.text":["UCBLogo is a free Logo implementation developed by Brian Harvey and his students at the University of California, Berkeley.
