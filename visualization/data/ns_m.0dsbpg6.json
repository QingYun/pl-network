Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009 and announced it for the first time in 2010. The same year, work shifted from the initial compiler to the self-hosting compiler written in Rust. Known as rustc, it successfully compiled itself in 2011. The self-hosted compiler uses LLVM as its back end.\\nThe first numbered pre-alpha release of the Rust compiler occurred in January 2012. Rust 1.0, the first stable release, was released on May 15, 2015.\\nRust is developed entirely in the open and solicits feedback and contributions from the community. The design of the language has been refined through the experiences of writing the Servo layout engine and the Rust compiler. Although its development is sponsored by Mozilla, it is a community project.
