CFScript resembles JavaScript. Some ColdFusion developers prefer it since it has less visual and typographical overhead than ordinary CFML; only the actual changes are represented in the code (whereas normal CFML would involve CFSET tags at every line).\\nAll CFScript code must be contained within a CFScript tag pair, as follows:\\nWhile many ColdFusion tags have exact CFScript analogies, there are quite a few tags that do not. These include both complex tags that would be difficult to duplicate and simple tags that are easy to imitate (using ColdFusion UDF's):\\nComplex:\\nSimple:\\nWhile there may not be direct substitutions for all tags, it is often still possible to achieve the results of a tag in script, but via a different syntax. For example this is how to get a query into a variable in CFSCRIPT without writing a UDF:\\nSince Coldfusion 8 cfscript has supported syntax abbreviations that are common in many other programming languages, such as \\\"++\\\", \\\"<=\\\" and \\\"+=\\\"."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/8036673>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["CFScript"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1256y1zdk"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
