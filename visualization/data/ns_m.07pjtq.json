Other major goals are:\\nThe default scripting language in StepTalk is Smalltalk. This is because Smalltalk is a very simple language and is easy to learn. There are just a few basic principles that the user has to know to be able to use the language and it is close to the natural language. Smalltalk uses a similar approach to that of Objective-C, the language used in GNUstep itself.\\nStepTalk works on any platform that GNUstep works on. Ports to native Mac OS X Cocoa framework are being developed by various contributors."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/2581887>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["StepTalk"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125b41kyl"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
