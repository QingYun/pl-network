The designers' goal was to create a language:\\nEuler employs a general type concept. In Euler, arrays, procedures, and switches are not quantities which are declared and named by identifiers: they are not (as opposed to ALGOL) quantities which are on the same level as variables, rather, these quantities are on the level of numeric and boolean constants. Thus, besides the traditional numeric and logical constants, Euler introduces the following additional types:\\nAll constants can be assigned to variables, which have the same form as in ALGOL, but for which no fixed types are specified: Euler is a dynamically typed programming language. Furthermore, a procedure can produce a value of any type when executed, and this type can vary from one call of the procedure to the next. Similarly, the elements of a list can have values of any type and these can be different from element to element within the list. So, when the list elements are labels, a switch is obtained. If the elements are procedures, a procedure list is obtained (which is not available in ALGOL"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/908540>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:award.award_winning_work.awards_won":[{"ns:award.award_honor.year":["1984"],"ns:award.award_honor.notes_description":["For developing a sequence of innovative computer languages, EULER, ALGOL-W, MODULA and PASCAL."],"ns:award.award_honor.ceremony":["ns:m.010nzvmq"],"ns:award.award_honor.honored_for":["ns:m.057fd"],"ns:award.award_honor.award":["ns:m.07n52"],"rdf:type":["ns:award.award_honor"],"ns:freebase.valuenotation.is_reviewed":["ns:m.0bzy7yg"],"ns:award.award_honor.award_winner":["ns:m.05fgl"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["Niklaus Wirth"],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1965"],"ns:type.object.name":["Euler"],"rdf:type":["ns:symbols.namesake"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125fmxfdm"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.06w_b"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:symbols.namesake.named_after":["ns:m.04jzj"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0q1x"]}}
