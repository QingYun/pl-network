Software developers writing in C are encouraged to conform to the standards, as doing so aids portability between compilers.\\nThe first standard for C was published by ANSI. Although this document was subsequently adopted by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and subsequent revisions published by ISO have been adopted by ANSI, the name ANSI C (rather than ISO C) is still more widely used. While some software developers use the term ISO C, others are standards bodyâ€“neutral and use Standard C.\\nIn 1983, the American National Standards Institute formed a committee, X3J11, to establish a standard specification of C. After a long and arduous process, the standard was completed in 1989 and ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 \\\"Programming Language C.\\\" This version of the language is often referred to as \\\"ANSI C\\\", or sometimes \\\"C89\\\" (to distinguish it from C99).\\nThis standard has been withdrawn by INCITS.\\nIn 1990, the ANSI C standard (with a few minor modifications) was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization as"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/3172>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:user.rictic.programming_languages.programming_language_version.superlanguage_of":[{"rdfs:label":["K&R C"],"key:en":["k_r_c"],"ns:book.book_subject.works":[{"key:user.avh.ellerdale":[[]],"ns:user.avh.default_domain.ellerdale_topic.ellerdale_id":[[]],"ns:book.written_work.copyright_date":[[]],"ns:book.written_work.date_of_first_publication":[[]],"ns:common.topic.description":[[]],"rdfs:label":[[]],"key:base.ranker.rankerurlname":[[]],"key:en":[[]],"ns:book.written_work.author":["Dennis Ritchie"],"ns:book.written_work.subjects":["ns:m.03_5ywq"],"ns:common.topic.article":[[]],"ns:book.written_work.original_language":[[]],"ns:book.book.editions":[[]],"ns:type.object.name":["The C Programming Language"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.topic"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:book.book"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125cb1p7j"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xryvm"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["K&R C"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:book.book_subject"],"rdf:type":["ns:user.rictic.programming_languages.topic"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1255djnz9"],"ns:user.rictic.programming_languages.programming_language_version.sublanguage_of":["ns:m.0146x"],"ns:user.rictic.programming_languages.programming_language_version.language":["ns:m.01t6b"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xryxh"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["ANSI C"],"rdf:type":["ns:user.rictic.programming_languages.topic"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125bs_15l"],"ns:user.rictic.programming_languages.programming_language_version.language":["ns:m.01t6b"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.042vgj"]}}
