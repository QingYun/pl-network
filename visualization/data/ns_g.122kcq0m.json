The difference between Baltie and other programming languages is that Baltie uses icons instead of written text, though in Baltie 4, C# text commands are allowed.\\nIcon languages Baltie 2 and Baltie 3 were developed by Czech company SGP Systems in 1996 and next version in 1999 from the language called Baltazar (1993) and are based on the C language. Baltie 4 C# is already based on C#\\nBaltie 2 was the first publicly shipped version. Ran on Microsoft DOS 5.0 and allows users to build their programs using icon commands. The environment was very limited and targeted only for very young children (3+ years). Only commands like \\\"Go\\\", \\\"Turn Left\\\", \\\"Turn Right\\\", \\\"Conjure\\\" were implemented and building stand-alone executable application was not possible. The application itself was developed in SGP Systems's language called Baltazar based on C language in early 1995.\\nblbost\\nBaltie 4 C# is an educational programming language which is a continuation of Baltie 3.
