Historically, the vast majority of programmers saw their workflow in terms of the edit/compile/link cycle, with separate tools dedicated to each task. Programmers wrote source code and entered it using a text editor, a compiler then created object code from source (often requiring multiple passes), and a linker combined object code with runtime libraries to produce an executable program."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/38273>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:base.ontologies.ontology_instance.equivalent_instances":[{"ns:base.ontologies.ontology_instance_mapping.uri":["<http://sw.opencyc.org/2008/06/10/concept/Mx4rvVjHT5wpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA>"],"ns:base.ontologies.ontology_instance_mapping.ontology":["ns:m.04dm2p_"],"rdf:type":["ns:base.ontologies.ontology_instance_mapping"],"ns:base.ontologies.ontology_instance_mapping.freebase_topic":["ns:m.09jsd"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Turbo Pascal"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1255m8l35"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.05y49"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"]}}
