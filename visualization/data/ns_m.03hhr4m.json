The compiler converts a source .neko file into a bytecode .n file that can be executed with the virtual machine. Since Neko is dynamically typed with no fixed classes, a developer only has to find the proper runtime mapping (as opposed to type mapping) so that code executes correctly. As the Neko FAQ puts it: \\\"...it is easier to write a new or existing language on the NekoVM than it is for the CLR / JVM, since you donâ€™t have to deal with a highlevel type system. Also, this means that languages can interoperate more easily since they only need to share the same data structures and not always the same types.\\\"\\nNeko requires compilation before execution, like other scripting languages such as Groovy. Since Neko doesn't need to be interpreted at runtime, it executes faster. The haXe programming language compiles to Neko code, among other targets.\\nNeko includes a mod_neko module for the Apache server. As such, it can process user input using GET and POST requests:"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/15110419>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://nekovm.org/>"],"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj32"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bl0_9l"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.03hhr4m"]}],"ns:common.topic.image":[{"ns:type.content.blob_id":["f63b14b06e9e8ca5b4e79d1282c648a841b685a64a096148a846bda67e7a2e61"],"ns:type.content.length":["4331"],"ns:common.licensed_object.license":["ns:m.02x6b"],"ns:type.content.language":["ns:m.04l"],"ns:type.content.media_type":["ns:m.08y0"],"ns:type.content.uploaded_by":["ns:m.0hjby7_"],"ns:type.content.source":["ns:m.0hjntgq"],"ns:type.object.name":["Neko"],"rdfs:label":["Neko"],"rdf:type":["ns:type.content"],"ns:common.image.appears_in_topic_gallery":["ns:m.03hhr4m"],"ns:common.image.size":["ns:m.01xj8tg"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2005"],"ns:type.object.name":["Neko"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125ch286z"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.0gkc5"]}}
