The Language is based on a BASIC-like syntax, taking advantage of Microsoft’s .NET technology, to allow additional libraries, graphical user interface design of windows forms, rapid application development (RAD), and .NET framework compatible compilation. The language implements a unique way of adding objects to a program without being object-oriented. Its advantages are simplicity, development pace and the integration with .NET framework. A special version of the integrated development environment (IDE) allows developing straight onto the mobile device.\\nIn 2010 a version for Android phones/tablets was released, this is a separate environment working along the same lines and the language is \\\"basic\\\" like and can be compiled to Android devices. \\nDual development platform: Basic4ppc allows development straight on the handheld device via a fully compatible Device IDE.
