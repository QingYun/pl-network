It includes an interpreter, native compiler, and step debugger. Roadsend Compiler can be used to build online web applications with FastCGI, offline web applications with an embedded web server (using the included \\\"MicroServer\\\"), desktop GUI applications with PHP-GTK, libraries, and console applications.\\nRoadsend PHP compiler is unique among PHP implementations because rather than compiling and interpreting PHP byte code, it compiles PHP source code to native machine code.\\nRoadsend PHP builds on Linux, Microsoft Windows (using MinGW), Mac OS X, and FreeBSD.
