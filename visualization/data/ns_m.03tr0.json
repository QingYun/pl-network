It is related to SNOBOL and SL5, string processing languages. Icon is not object-oriented, but an object-oriented extension called Idol was developed in 1996 which eventually became Unicon.\\nThe Icon language is derived from the ALGOL-class of structured programming languages, and thus has syntax similar to C or Pascal. Icon is most similar to Pascal, using := syntax for assignments, the procedure keyword and similar syntax. On the other hand, Icon uses C-style brackets for structuring execution groups, and programs start by running a procedure called \\\"main\\\".\\nIn many ways Icon also shares features with most scripting programming languages (as well as SNOBOL and SL5, from which they were taken): variables do not have to be declared, types are cast automatically, and numbers can be converted to strings and back automatically. Another feature common to many scripting languages, but not all, is the lack of a line-ending character; in Icon, lines not ended by a semicolon get ended by an implied semicolon if it makes sense.\\nProcedures are the"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/14801>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1977"],"ns:type.object.name":["Icon"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125633bx2"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.06w_b"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.dialects":["ns:m.03n9v6"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.0chpd"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0q1x"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.079lq"]}}
