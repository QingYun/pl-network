Vojtisek and F. Fondement. It is also inspired by the previous experience on MTL, the first transformation language created by Triskell, and by the Xion action language for UML.\\nThe name Kermeta is an abbreviation for \\\"Kernel Metamodeling\\\" and reflects the fact that the language is conceived as a core for (meta-)modeling. The Breton language consonance of this name is an intentional reflection of the Triskell team's location in Britanny.\\nKermeta, and its execution platform under Eclipse is currently available under its version 1.4.1. It is open-source, under the Eclipse Public License.\\nKermeta is a modeling and aspect oriented programming language. Its underlying metamodel conforms to the EMOF standard.
