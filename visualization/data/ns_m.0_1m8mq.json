{"ns:m.0_1m8mq":{"ns:common.topic.description":["ELI is an interactive array programming language system based on APL. It has the most of functionalities of ISO APL standard. In addition to classical APL, ELI features list for non-homogeneous or non-rectangular data, complex numbers, symbols, temporal data, and control structures. A scripting file facility helps a user to easily organize programs in a fashion similar to using #include in C, which also provides convenient data input/output. Moreover, ELI has dictionaries, tables and a basic set of SQL-like statements. For performance, ELI offers a compiler restricted to flat array programs.\\nBy replacing each APL character with one or two ASCII characters, ELI retains APLâ€™s succinct and expressive way of doing array programming, i.e. compared with MATLAB or Python, ELI encourages a dataflow style of programming where the output of one operation feeds the input of another that results in greater productivity and clarity of code.\\nELI is free and available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS."],"rdfs:label":["ELI"],"key:dataworld.freeq":["job_91c5f39d-30ad-46ba-bb20-a3e294e29df8_var_en_wikipedia_org_wiki_ELI_$0028programming_language$0029"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["Wai-Mee Ching"],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2011"],"ns:type.object.name":["ELI"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.11b5pgvzs6"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.03m62t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0q1d"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.0q1d"]}}
