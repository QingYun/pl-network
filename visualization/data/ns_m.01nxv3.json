It is currently positioned, alongside the more recently introduced Java, as the language for programming the SAP Application Server, part of its NetWeaver platform for building business applications. The syntax of ABAP is somewhat similar to COBOL.\\nABAP is one of the many application-specific fourth-generation languages (4GLs) first developed in the 1980s. It was originally the report language for SAP R/2, a platform that enabled large corporations to build mainframe business applications for materials management and financial and management accounting.\\nABAP used to be an abbreviation of Allgemeiner BerichtsAufbereitungsProzessor, German for \\\"generic report preparation processor\\\", but was later renamed to the English Advanced Business Application Programming. ABAP was one of the first languages to include the concept of Logical Databases (LDBs), which provides a high level of abstraction from the basic database level(s).\\nThe ABAP programming language"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/271832>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.image":[{"ns:type.content.blob_id":["4141f0e049e728ab423b8f8a1d45499270c81c12f381cebc372ac6360122792a"],"ns:type.content.length":["14819"],"rdfs:label":["Data types"],"ns:type.content.source":["ns:m.0cphxp6"],"ns:common.licensed_object.license":["ns:m.05smz"],"ns:type.content.media_type":["ns:m.08wq"],"ns:common.image.size":["ns:m.0cphxns"],"ns:type.object.name":["Data types"],"rdf:type":["ns:type.content"],"ns:common.image.appears_in_topic_gallery":["ns:m.01nxv3"],"ns:type.content.uploaded_by":["ns:m.0220tm0"],"ns:type.content.language":["ns:m.04l"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://scn.sap.com/community/abap>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.01nxv3"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1983"],"ns:type.object.name":["ABAP"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1259dwnfs"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.06w_b"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.07sbkfb"]}}
