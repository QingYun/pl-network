It is built on the Java Virtual Machine and incorporates features similar to Java, Perl, Ruby, Smalltalk, and various BASIC implementations. Its main focus is on the fields of science, engineering, physics, text processing, and education.\\nOne of the distinguishing characteristics of Frink is that it tracks units of measure through all calculations. This allows all values to contain a quantity and its units of measure. Frink understands how different units of measure interrelate, such as a length cubed is a volume, or power multiplied by time is energy. Different units of measure can be mixed in calculations, and Frink automatically ensures that the calculations lead to a result with the expected dimensions.\\nSince gravitation is given as a floating-point value, the answer is also floating point.\\nThe statement above could be rewritten many ways - using different abbreviations and different target units, for instance:\\nHere the built-in unit \\\"gravity\\\" is used, which is specified in Frink's units file as a rational number.
