It will be fully dynamically typed and use automatic memory management, as the current version. It is thus similar to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, Smalltalk, and Tcl. Python is developed as an open source project, managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation. \\n\\nPython 3 is being developed with the same philosophy as in prior versions, so any reference to Python philosophy will apply to Python 3 as well. However, as Python has accumulated new and redundant ways to program the same task, Python 3 has an emphasis on removing duplicative constructs and modules, in keeping with \\\"There should be one￢ﾀﾔand preferably only one￢ﾀﾔobvious way to do it\\\". \\n\\nNonetheless, Python 3 will remain a multi-paradigm language. Coders will still have options among object orientation, structured programming, functional programming, and aspect-oriented programming and other paradigms; but within such broad choices, the details are intended to be more obvious in Python 3 than they have become in Python 2.x. \\n\\nPython 3 (or more formally, for the initial release, Python 3.0), Python 3000, and Py3K are all names for"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/5027503>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Python 3"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12596nqqw"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
