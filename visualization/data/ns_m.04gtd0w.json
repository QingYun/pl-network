It is also known as SCAR Divi, SCAR Divi CDE, and many other names. The program was originally made by Aivars Irmejs, and is maintained by Frédéric Hannes. The program can be downloaded from Freddy1990's website. It is a hybrid of the Delphi and Pascal programming languages. Users and scripters can use this program to carry out macro commands on games, and other computer based programs; the most popular game SCAR is used for is RuneScape by Jagex Ltd..\\nGiven its ability to simulate mouse and keyboard input, its support of the Windows API, and a built-in HTTP client, SCAR is also versatile and powerful as a workflow automation language for various tasks in Windows, in a similar way to Windows Script Host. One design flaw with SCAR is that while its syntax highlighting recognizes certain Delphi keywords and bolds them as they are typed, SCAR's interpreter does not implement these keywords and gives errors upon using them. An example of this is the asm keyword which, in Delphi, allows the developer to write low-level assembly instructions."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/18682753>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2003"],"ns:type.object.name":["SCAR programming language"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125bxs_6g"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.05y49"]}}
