It is intended to be usable not only as a scripting and application programming tool, but also as a substitute for a wide set of World Wide Web technologies. Complete with standard extensions and libraries, AWL is capable of formatted text mark-up (like HTML), structured data definition (XML), complex styles and macro definitions (CSS), embedded vector graphics (SVG) and page scripting/behavior programming (JScript/JavaScript). \\n\\nAWL can be described as a multi-paradigm language, containing many functional, procedural and object-oriented features. Most principal ancestors of AWL include LISP and Scheme, Perl, Ruby and some other programming languages, including even APL (multi-dimensional arrays) and SNOBOL (regular expressions/patterns). As in LISP and many modern functional languages, lists serve as a most important tool of data integration. Primary evaluation mechanism is functors: functional primitives combining semantics of built-in functions, operators and statements of the traditional languages. AWL runs as an interpreter, although code is precompiled, and all name bindings are"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/10472471>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["AWL"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1254_qsz4"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
