AMPLE was produced by Hybrid Technologies, Cambridge, England in the mid-1980s. Many AMPLE programs were published in Acorn User magazine.\\nAdvanced Multi-Purpose LanguagE (AMPLE) is a scripting language and a part of the Falcon Framework software framework developed for the Apollo/Domain computer by Mentor Graphics. It is a dynamically typed C-like programming language, with for example vector types added.\\nAs the Apollo/Domain was very popular in computer-aided engineering (especially in electronic design automation), AMPLE is still used in several Mentor Graphics applications such as Design Architect IC and IC Station. These tools are built on the Falcon Framework, and run on Unix and Linux workstations. Some of the PCB design tools even run on Windows NT.\\nExample:\\nAMPLE Functions feature qualifiers for Transcript mode, a Quick Help reference text, default values for function arguments."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/216864>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["AMPLE"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1257vtscv"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
