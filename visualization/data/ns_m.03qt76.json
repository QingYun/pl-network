Refal-5 is a dialect of Refal developed at the City College of New York and supported by Refal Systems Inc. \\n\\nREFAL is one of the oldest members of the functional languages family; it was first implemented by Valentin Turchin in 1968 in Russia. REFAL combines mathematical simplicity with the practicality needed for writing large programs.  \\n\\nUnlike typical functional languages (such as Lisp) and like some symbolic computation languages (such as Mathematica), REFAL is based on pattern-matched term-rewriting. Its designers claim that the typical REFAL program is on the average two to three times shorter than the analogous program in Lisp and yet more readable. It is also claimed that REFAL is conceptually simpler when compared to Prolog since its pattern matching/replacing works forwards (i.e., starting from the givens) instead of backwards (i.e., starting from the goal), as is the case in Prolog. Some claim that this is a more natural approach to writing algorithms and that it also makes them easier to"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/928350>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["REFAL programming language"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125f8r_6h"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
