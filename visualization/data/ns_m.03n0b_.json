This allows eliminating named variables.\\nThe values that FP programs map into one another comprise a set which is closed under sequence formation:\\nThese values can be built from any set of atoms: booleans, integers, reals, characters, etc.:\\n⊥ is the undefined value, or bottom. Sequences are bottom-preserving:\\nFP programs are functions f that each map a single value x into another:\\nFunctions are either primitive (i.e., provided with the FP environment) or are built from the primitives by program-forming operations (also called functionals).\\nAn example of primitive function is constant, which transforms a value x into the constant-valued function x̄. Functions are strict:\\nAnother example of a primitive function is the selector function family, denoted by 1,2,... where:\\nIn contrast to primitive functions, functionals operate on other functions. For example, some functions have a unit value, such as 0 for addition and 1 for multiplication. The functional unit produces such a value when applied to a function f that has one:\\nThese are the core"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/899253>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["John Backus"],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1977"],"ns:type.object.name":["FP"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1258wsksr"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.0jp72"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.03m_l4"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0q1d"]}}
