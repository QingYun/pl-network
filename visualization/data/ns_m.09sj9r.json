An early compiler for BitC, known as BitCC, was first released in an alpha form (v. 0.10.1) on June 17, 2006, and in the same year Shapiro left Johns Hopkins to form The EROS Group, LLC, and the BitC project became a joint effort between the two organizations.\\nAt the end of 2008 the specification for the first released version of the language and its compiler converged towards its final form, and the prototype compiler was demonstrated to have favorable performance on microbenchmarks.\\nBitC combines the concepts of higher-order functional programming languages like ML and Haskell with the close hardware interaction of low-level"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/3654729>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["BitC"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1256gx240"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.055mc"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.02ykw"]}}
