Its original implementation was in PDP-10 assembly language. It was later implemented on Multics using PL/I. Maclisp developed considerably in its lifetime, adding major features along the way which in other language systems would typically correspond to major release numbers.\\nMaclisp was used to implement the Macsyma symbolic algebra program; Macsyma's development also drove a number of features in Maclisp. The SHRDLU blocks-world program was written in Maclisp, and so the language was in widespread use in the artificial intelligence research community through the early 1980s.
