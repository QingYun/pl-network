The name stands for ZZT Object Oriented Programming language.\\nZZT-oop is event-driven. A ZZT game is composed of a set of objects, each of which has an attached script. Scripts are executed concurrently (one command being taken in turn from each script running on the current screen), and objects communicate by passing messages to one another.\\nThe ZZT-oop language is limited in application. It was designed for simplicity rather than flexibility. Boolean flags are the only kind of variables, making arithmetic quite difficult; the programmer is forced to be creative with algorithms, often relying on physical movement, possibly in invisible (but still physically present) objects, rather than arithmetic calculations.\\nAlthough ZZT-oop calls itself \\\"object-oriented\\\", objects are not instantiable due to their physical nature, meaning that one needs to duplicate much code to create complex systems.\\nZZT-oop also lacks functions, and routines are likely to be interrupted by rogue messages — including ones sent by the object itself when it is shot or touched — and never completed."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/347071>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["ZZT-oop"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125grm6xr"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"]}}
