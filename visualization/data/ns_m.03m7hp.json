Factor is dynamically typed and has automatic memory management, as well as powerful metaprogramming features. The language has a single implementation featuring a self-hosted optimizing compiler and an interactive development environment. The Factor distribution includes a large standard library.\\nSlava Pestov created Factor in 2003 as a scripting language for a video game. The initial implementation, now referred to as JFactor, was implemented in Java and ran on the Java Virtual Machine. Though the early language resembled modern Factor superficially in terms of syntax, the modern language is very different in practical terms and the current implementation is much faster.\\nThe language has changed significantly over time. Originally, Factor programs centered around manipulating Java objects with Java's reflection capabilities. From the beginning, the design philosophy has been to modify the language to suit programs written in it. As the Factor implementation and standard libraries grew more detailed, the need for certain language features became clear, and they were added. JFactor did not have an object"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/891398>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["Slava Pestov"],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2003"],"ns:type.object.name":["Factor"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1259t_zt0"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.03p3g9"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.0gh50t7"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0gd42"]}}
