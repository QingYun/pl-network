Joy and Cat differ from most functional languages (e.g. Scheme, Haskell) and language formalisms (e.g. lambda calculus, combinatory logic) in that they are based on the composition of functions rather than function application. Cat and Joy both bear more resemblance to combinatorial logic calculi (such as the SKI calculus or the B,C,K,W system) than to the lambda calculus due to the lack of names.\\nThe Cat language was designed with static typing in mind, and as such there is somewhat less flexibility but more safety than is available in the Joy programming language.\\nCat is intended as a multi-purpose language with an emphasis on usage as an intermediate language and as an educational language.\\nLike Joy, programs in Cat are constructed from existing programs using two operations: composition and quotation. All Cat programs can be thought of as functions that map from one stack to another. Because Cat has no operations that refer to previous stack states, Cat can be easily implemented using a single mutable shared stack.\\nTwo adjacent terms in Cat imply the composition of functions that"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/10447803>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["Christopher Diggins"],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.description":["Home page"],"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj32"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bk4gn0"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://cat-language.com>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.02qdfmg"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2006"],"ns:type.object.name":["Cat"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1258gz1c9"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.03p3g9"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0cglf"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.05bzv69"]}}
