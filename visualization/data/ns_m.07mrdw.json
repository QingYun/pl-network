The language combines imperative and declarative programming by using a prolog syntax that allows calls to Java functions. In this way a strong Java code base is combined with Prolog features such as backtracking.\\nProva is derived from Mandarax, a Java-based inference system developed by Jens Dietrich. Prova extends Mandarax by providing a proper language syntax, native syntax integration with Java, agent messaging and reaction rules. The development of this language was supported by the grant provided within the EU projects GeneStream and BioGRID. In the project, the language is used as a rule-based backbone for distributed web applications in biomedical data integration, in particular, the GoPubMed system.\\nThe design goals of Prova:\\nProva aims to provide support for data integration tasks when the following is important:\\nProva has been used as the key service integration engine in the Xcalia product where it is used for computing efficient global execution plans across multiple data sources such as Web services, TP monitors transactions"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/2555501>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Prova"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1258dcndm"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
