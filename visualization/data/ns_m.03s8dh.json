They are based on the C and C++ programming languages and extend these with constructs to express parallel loops and the forkâ€“join idiom.\\nOriginally developed in the 1990s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the group of Charles E. Leiserson, Cilk was later commercialized as Cilk++ by a spinoff company, Cilk Arts. That company was subsequently acquired by Intel, which increased compatibility with existing C and C++ code, calling the result Cilk Plus."],"key:en":["cilk"],"ns:common.topic.official_website":["<http://www.cilk.com/>"],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.text":["Cilk is a general-purpose programming language designed for multithreaded parallel computing. The commercial instantiation is Intel Cilk Plus.\\nThe biggest principle behind the design of the Cilk language is that the programmer should be responsible for exposing the parallelism, identifying elements that can safely be executed in parallel; it should then be left to the run-time environment, particularly the scheduler, to decide during execution how to actually divide the work between processors. It is because these responsibilities are separated that a Cilk program can run without rewriting on any number of processors, including one.\\nThe Cilk language has been developed since 1994 at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science. It is based on ANSI C, with the addition of just a handful of Cilk-specific keywords. When the Cilk keywords are removed from Cilk source code, the result is a valid C program, called the serial elision (or C elision) of the full Cilk program. Cilk is a faithful extension of C and the serial elision of any Cilk program is always a valid serial implementation in C of the semantics of the parallel Cilk program.
