A software system may be seen as a set of information transformations. The Unix system itself may be viewed as a framework to use and to build transformation programs (filters) from basic transformation languages like grep, sed, awk, perl, etc. A software development process itself may also be considered as a chain of transformation from abstract requirements to executable systems.\\nSome transformation languages exhibit the characteristic of homoiconicity, in which the language used for expressing a data model is also related to or identical to the transformation language. The most noteworthy example is the relationship between XML and XSLT. This kind of emphasis is viewed by some as having a favorable compatibility with model-driven engineering."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/4773563>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Model transformation language"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1255vfly_"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
