Some of the better known are presented below.\\nOriginally, machine code was the first and only way to program computers. Assembly language was the next type of language used, and thus is one of the oldest families of computer languages in use today. Many dialects and implementations are available, usually some for each computer processor architecture. It is very basic and termed a low level programming language. It is one of the more difficult languages to work with being untyped and rigid, but this is how computers work at low level. Several simplified dialects exist for education.\\nLow level languages must be written for a specific processor architecture and cannot be written or taught in isolation without referencing the processor for which it was"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/426660>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Educational programming language"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language_paradigm"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12594thhx"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language_paradigm.languages":["ns:m.0gzx5x"]}}
