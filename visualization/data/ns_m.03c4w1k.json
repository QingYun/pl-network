FastPak for Java uses a single Java virtual machine (JVM) to launch multiple applications, rather than using one JVM per application.\\nSignificance A standard Java application is launched when a user starts, directly or indirectly, a JVM, which in turn reads the Java bytecodes comprising the application, and then executes them as instructions. Each time a user launches a Java application in this manner, a new JVM is started. If, for example, a user runs N applications on a system, the user will in turn have N corresponding JVMs running.\\nEach running instance of a JVM can essentially be seen as a sub-operating system executing within the hosting system. Each independently executing JVM is extremely resource intensive and redunandantly consumes system resources. As a result, as a user executes more and more Java applications, the load placed on the system becomes very high. This can often manifest itself as a significant and observable performance decrease on the end users system. Because of the heavy loading, many developers have shied away from"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/13423025>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["FastPak for Java"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1258g5nzh"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
