It formed the basis for what was initially a highly extended Eliza called \\\"A.L.I.C.E.\\\" (\\\"Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity\\\"), which won the annual Loebner Prize Competition in Artificial Intelligence three times, and was also the Chatterbox Challenge Champion in 2004.\\nBecause the A.L.I.C.E. AIML set was released under the GNU GPL, and because most AIML interpreters are offered under a free or open source license, many \\\"Alicebot clones\\\" have been created based upon the original implementation of the program and its AIML knowledge base. Free AIML sets in several languages have been developed and made available by the user community. There are AIML interpreters available in Java, Ruby, Python, C++, C#, Pascal, and other languages (see below). A semi-formal specification and a W3C XML Schema for AIML are available.\\nAIML contains several elements. The most important of these are described in further detail below.\\nCategories in"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/46742>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["AIML"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12558x1_2"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:common.topic.subjects":["ns:m.03gmpl"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.08745"]}}
