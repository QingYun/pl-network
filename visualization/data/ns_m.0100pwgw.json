{"ns:m.0100pwgw":{"ns:common.topic.description":["Hack is a programming language for the HipHop Virtual Machine, created by Facebook as a dialect of PHP. The language implementation is open source, licensed under the BSD License.\\nHack allows programmers to use both dynamic typing and static typing. This kind of a type system is called gradual typing, which is also implemented in other programming languages such as ActionScript. Hack's type system allows types to be specified for function arguments, function return values, and class properties; however, types of local variables cannot be specified."],"rdfs:label":["Hack"],"key:dataworld.freeq":["job_a7c6672a-3218-436d-9199-448dbdeb2124_var_en_wikipedia_org_wiki_Hack_$0028programming_language$0029"],"ns:computer.programming_language.developers":["Facebook"],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2014"],"ns:type.object.name":["Hack"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.11b5lzkws1"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.07sbkfb"]}}
