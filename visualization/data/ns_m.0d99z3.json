SuperTalk is a descendant of HyperTalk.\\nOne of the most powerful features SuperCard adds to the HyperTalk language is user properties. Where HyperTalk had a fixed set of properties on its objects, SuperCard scripters can use the define property propName command to add new properties to buttons and fields. These properties can contain arbitrary text (including numbers and object references, which are also represented using text in xTalks), and even dumps of entire files.\\nSuperTalk provides several variations on HyperTalk's answer and answer file commands, which let one choose several items from a list, choose an icon from all available icons, pick a MIDI instrument to play sound with, or choose a file of a supported image format (including a preview), or disks and folders. Different from HyperTalk's dialogs, SuperTalk answer and ask dialogs do not all resize dynamically to hold more text. However, since SuperCard allows having cards (i.e. \\\"pages\\\") in windows of arbitrary types, one can easily build one's own dialog that is large enough.
