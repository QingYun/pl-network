FAUST aims at being complementary to existing audio languages by offering a viable and efficient alternative to C/C++ to develop signal processing libraries, audio plug-ins or standalone applications. The language is based on a simple and well defined formal semantics. A FAUST program denotes a signal processor, a mathematical function that transforms input signals into output signals.\\nAs said in the introduction, the FAUST programming model combines a functional programming approach with a block-diagram syntax:\\nA FAUST program doesnâ€™t describe a sound or a group of sounds, but a signal processor, something that transforms input signals and produces output signals. The program source is organized as a set of definitions with at least the definition of the keyword process (the equivalent of main in C):\\nThe FAUST compiler translates FAUST programs into equivalent C++ programs taking care of generating the most efficient code.
