Compile-time initialization of variables, on the other hand, went from right to left.\\nThe assignment operator returns the stored value, so you could store it multiple times: 5 =: a =: b would store 5 into both the A and B variables. It shares this direction with Plankalk√ºl, early ALGOL drafts, and Mary, another little known programming language developed in Norway, but also the popular C programming"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/5081365>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["PLANC"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125cr6wgl"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
