Allegro CL is available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and various Unix platforms, supporting 32 or 64 bits. Internationalization support is based on Unicode. It supports various external text encodings and provides string and character types based on UCS-2. Allegro CL can be used with and without its integrated development environment, which is available for Windows and Linux, and on Mac OS X in version 8.2. The IDE includes various development tools like an editor and an interface designer. Allegro CL can be used to deliver applications.\\nAllegro CL is available as a Free Express Edition for non-commercial use.
