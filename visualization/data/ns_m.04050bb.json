It was designed for use in application and systems programming, and implemented to meet the demands of network computing and mobility, and to provide a vehicle for rapid prototyping of software. It intends to make programming enjoyable, through the well-designed combination of the best ideas found in object-oriented, concurrent, functional, and logical programming paradigms, and the embodiment of a design philosophy: simplicity, efficiency, uniformity and consistency with conventions. So, Fuxi adopts a syntactical system and an object model strongly influenced by major current languages, such as C, C++, C#, Java, though the language itself is more declarative.\\nFuxi reflects the major aspects of Object-oriented programming, but differs from C++ and Java in that it differentiates methods into functions, clauses, and triggers, and gives them a uniform syntax through pattern matching. The notable language features include:\\nThe following is a simple example of Fuxi, which calculates the Fibonacci numbers:\\nFuxi Language Homepage"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/16754339>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.fuxi.org>"],"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0blvmxl"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.04050bb"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Fuxi Programming Language"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125dd3k6q"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
