This committee included representatives from Adobe, Railo, and Open BlueDragon, but the committee was disbanded in 2010. General language discussions and feature suggestions now tend to happen on the CFML Conventional Wisdom Google Group or on various other CFML mailing lists.\\nIn its simplest form, like many other web scripting languages CFML augments standard HTML files with database commands, conditional operators, high-level formatting functions, and other elements to produce web applications. CFML also includes numerous other constructs including ColdFusion Components (CFCs), CFML's version of objects, that allow for separation of business logic from presentation.\\nCFML can be written"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/962933>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:book.book_subject.works":[{"key:authority.openlibrary.book":["OL10459886M"],"rdfs:label":["Reality Macromedia ColdFusion MX"],"key:base.ranker.rankerurlname":["reality-macromedia-coldfusion-mx$002F171098"],"key:en":["reality_macromedia_coldfusion_mx"],"ns:book.written_work.subjects":["ns:m.03tsq7"],"ns:book.written_work.author":[],"ns:type.object.name":["Reality Macromedia ColdFusion MX"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.topic"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:book.book"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125dsx6p5"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xryvm"]}],"ns:common.topic.image":[{"ns:type.content.length":["4137"],"rdfs:label":["Coldfusion"],"ns:type.content.blob_id":["d4c2bf1a84f0774ece8a672e486b35bbb32f477e4722c2d21f569fa205b1e118"],"ns:common.image.size":["ns:m.02_xm_x"],"ns:common.licensed_object.license":["ns:m.02x6b"],"ns:type.content.language":["ns:m.04l"],"ns:type.content.media_type":["ns:m.08x8"],"ns:type.content.uploaded_by":["ns:m.0chq2z0"],"ns:type.content.source":["ns:m.0chr1yb"],"ns:type.object.name":["Coldfusion"],"rdf:type":["ns:type.content"],"ns:common.image.appears_in_topic_gallery":["ns:m.03tsq7"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["Jeremy Allaire"],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1995"],"ns:type.object.name":["ColdFusion Markup Language"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1256k9ryx"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
