A new version was reimplemented and issued as Qi II in November 2008. The first version was free software, licensed under GPL. But, as GPL was perceived as unfriendly to commercial use, Qi II is available via two proprietary licenses: one for personal and educational use, and another for producing closed source software.\\nQi is written in Lisp. It includes most of the features common to modern functional programming languages such as pattern-matching, currying, partial applications, guards and (optional) static type checking.\\nQi was developed as part of the L21 project, which aims to modernise Lisp to meet the challenges of twenty-first century computing. In his lecture, Tarver outlined a series of current challenges to Lisp which he argued were damaging to the wider use of the language. Specifically he identified Common Lisp's lack of pattern-matching, inconsistency with respect to lambda calculus theory (partial applications being missing), procedural contamination and lack of static typing. These deficiencies, Tarver argued, had led to a general abandonment of Lisp as a teaching"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/9765495>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.image":[{"ns:type.content.length":["224955"],"ns:type.content.blob_id":["2de03b49bd480f20bc9f530c14d37d1eee83bb91e6c6554be40908802bf67963"],"ns:common.image.rights_holder_text_attribution":["Dr. Mark Travor"],"rdfs:label":["Qi-Architecture"],"ns:type.content.uploaded_by":["ns:m.0220tm0"],"ns:common.image.size":["ns:m.029115t"],"ns:common.licensed_object.license":["ns:m.034jd"],"ns:type.content.source":["ns:m.063dnvk"],"ns:type.content.media_type":["ns:m.08wq"],"ns:type.object.name":["Qi-Architecture"],"rdf:type":["ns:type.content"],"ns:common.image.appears_in_topic_gallery":["ns:m.02prj6h"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Qi"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125618_vg"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.02ykw"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.04kyw"]}}
