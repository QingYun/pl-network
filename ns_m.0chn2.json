The procedural paradigm was epitomized by Lisp [McCarthy et al. 1962] which featured recursive procedures that operated on list structures.\\nThe logical paradigm was epitomized by uniform proof procedure resolution theorem provers [Robinson 1965]. According to the logical paradigm it was “cheating” to incorporate procedural knowledge [Green 1969].\\nPlanner was invented for the purposes of the procedural embedding of knowledge [Hewitt 1971] and was a rejection of the resolution uniform proof procedure paradigm [Robinson 1965], which\\nPlanner was a kind of hybrid between the"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/46143>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1969"],"ns:type.object.name":["Planner"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125h68mr_"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.05vpz"],"ns:computer.programming_language.dialects":["ns:m.0k04hrk"]}}
