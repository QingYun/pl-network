It is now actively and further developed in the industry through the Gostai company founded in 2006.\\nThe urbiscript language can be best described as an orchestration script language: like Lua in video games, urbiscript can be used to glue together C++ components into a functional behavior, the CPU-intensive algorithmic part being left to C++ and the behavior scripting part being left to the script language which is more flexible, easy to maintain and allows"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/12658484>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.urbiforge.org>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.02w_5j4"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2003"],"ns:type.object.name":["Urbi"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12589msg6"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0jgqg"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
