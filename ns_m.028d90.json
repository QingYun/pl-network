{"ns:m.028d90":{"rdfs:label":["Chef"],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.text":["Chef is an esoteric (or joke) programming language designed by David Morgan-Mar. It is based on the manipulation of data values in a number of stacks; the same idea is used in assembly programming languages. Each program consists at minimum of the following:\\nThe joke is that the variables tend to be named after basic foodstuffs, the stacks are called 'mixing bowls' and the instructions for manipulating them 'mix', 'stir', etc.. A program, then, reads much like a cooking recipe.\\nA Hello World example program in Chef:\\nThe phrase \\\"Hello world!\\\" is encoded as ASCII values in the amount specifiers in the recipe. The ingredient names themselves are variable names, and are here named with a starting letter matching the letter encoded in the number in front for convenience, except that zucchini is the space and potatoes are the exclamation point.\\nThe order of the words is reversed because when the phrase \\\"hello world!\\\" is printed out, the ingredients are \\\"popped\\\" from the stack (also known as the mixing bowl). The last element (last ingredient) to be put in the stack is the first element out of the stack.\\nA Fibonacci example program can be found on the language's website."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/436800>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Chef"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1257w3wsk"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
