The new mission of Eclaire, in 1988, was to develop the first full-fledged programming language capable of \\\"server-client synchronosis\\\". Simply put, server-client synchronosis would provide for individuals to invoke the execution of the same executable running on his or her choice of the server (this would be, for example, at the time an ARPANET node, which would become the Internet) or client (usually a UNIX host or the arrival of telnet client).\\nWith the arrival of the World Wide Web, the new mission of Eclaire (by now called SKiP, which for all intents and purposes was Eclaire with array clefting, having been \\\"rechristened\\\" by Bob Harrison at Ohio"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/9503048>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["BCompile"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125dz6_z_"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
