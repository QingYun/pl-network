Like its younger sibling LOGO, it was an early foray into the technology of computer assisted instruction (CAI).\\nPILOT was developed by John Amsden Starkweather, a psychology professor at the University of California, San Francisco medical center. In 1962 he developed a simple language for automating learning tests called Computest. Starting in 1968, he developed a follow-on project called PILOT, for various computers of the time such as the SDS 940.\\nA line of PILOT code contains (from left to right) the following syntax elements:\\nA label can also be alone in a line, not followed by other code.
