It is a small Forth-like stack-oriented language, with syntax designed to make the code inherently obfuscated, confusing, and unreadable. It is also noteworthy for having a compiler of only 1024 bytes (written in 68000 assembly). According to Van Oortmerssen, FALSE provided the inspiration for various well-known esoteric languages, including brainfuck and Befunge.\\nFALSE is notably more tractable than most esoteric programming languages. The fundamental operations that it provides are reasonably sensible, and there is no gratuitous complexity. In these respects it stands in strong contrast to the behemoths Intercal and Malbolge. The difficulty of programming in FALSE comes mostly from the low-level nature of the language, which has the feel of a Forth-like assembly language. The remainder of the language's awkwardness comes from the concise punctuation-based syntax, which many people find more difficult than a more conventional word-based syntax.\\nThe language features basic arithmetic and logical operations, variables, subroutines, control flow statements,"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/436942>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://strlen.com/false/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.028dzm"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["FALSE"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125ck6wjc"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.01b5k"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
