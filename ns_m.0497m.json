It came to fame in 1994 when someone made an anonymous post to USENET regarding it. Kvikkalkul's origins are probably not as claimed, but instead it was likely invented as a joke, like INTERCAL. Unlike INTERCAL, it is not overtly humorous, and contains nothing terribly silly.\\nKvikkalkul was allegedly developed on Baudot code systems, and used only the \\\"figures\\\" mode, so the only characters in Kvikkalkul source are whitespace, digits, and a handful of punctuation characters. However, not even all of the punctuation characters available in \\\"figures\\\" mode is used, most notably the addition sign remains unused. The complete absence of letters is touted as a virtue because it makes it impossible to have misleading comments and object names. Without these crutches, reading a Kvikkalkul program requires one to work out what the program actually does.\\nThe main data type is a fixed-point ones' complement fractional number, originally of 15 bits but more in later implementations. The minimum representable number is a little above −1 (−1 + 2 with 15 bits), and"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/16841>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Kvikkalkul"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1259jvqrw"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
