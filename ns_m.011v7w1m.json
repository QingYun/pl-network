{"ns:m.011v7w1m":{"ns:common.topic.description":["X# is a low-level programming language developed for x86 processor architecture as a part of Cosmos operating system to make operating system development easier. X# was a programming language designed to bring some of C-like language syntax to assembly language. At the beginning, X# was a help for debugging services of Cosmos. The X# compiler is an open source console interface program with an atypical architecture. It parses lines of code into tokens and compares them with patterns. Finally, matched X# code patterns are translated to intel syntax x86 assembly, usually for the NASM compiler. In first versions, X# operation was mostly 1:1 with assembly code, but hasn't been the reason why the X# compiler was written."],"rdfs:label":["X#"],"key:dataworld.freeq":["job_c6727cc3-d1e9-4277-a977-e51355c3f364_var_en_wikipedia_org_wiki_X_Sharp"],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/38909105>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2009"],"ns:type.object.name":["X#"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
