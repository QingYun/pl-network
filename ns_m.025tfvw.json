When it was introduced in 1981 it was one of the first CASE tools on the commercial market. The developer tools run on IBM's MVS operating systems using TSO and PCs running MS-Windows and the target environments include IMS and CICS transaction processing systems. TELON supported multiple database technologies, including IBM's VSAM, IMS/DB, DB2, and Cullinet's IDMS.\\nTELON is an application code generator which uses macros to generate COBOL, COBOL II, or PL/I code that can run natively on the target environment without run-time proprietary code. Developers create screen designs in the TELON Design Facility (TDF) and define attributes for the screen. The design can then be run through a prototyper to test screen flow. Next, macros generate the code using the information created by the TDF. Lastly, the TELON Test Facility is used, in conjunction with code debuggers, to search for and fix bugs before the application is moved into production.\\nTELON was originally"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/5332972>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["CA-Telon"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1257psp4y"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
