Dr. Barry came to this conclusion when taking suggestions from a local elemetary school where he often applied his technique.\\nIt is supposed to be an efficient tool to become familiar with the core of programming and with programming patterns that can be applied in other languages needed to face the real world.\\nA++ is a language similar to C++, with its interpreter available in Scheme, Java, C, C++ and Python, and offers an ideal environment for basic training in programming,"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/425819>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2001"],"ns:type.object.name":["A++"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12586wvzl"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.04mg4"]}}
