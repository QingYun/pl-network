E is mainly descended from the concurrent language Joule and from Original-E, a set of extensions to Java for secure distributed programming. E combines message-based computation with Java-like syntax. A concurrency model based on event loops and promises ensures that deadlock can never occur.\\nThe entire language is designed with secure computing in mind; this is accomplished chiefly by strict adherence to the object-oriented computing model, which in its pure form has properties that support secure computing. The E language and its standard library employ a capability-based design philosophy throughout in order to help programmers build secure software and to enable software components to co-operate even if they don't fully trust each other. In E, object references serve as capabilities, hence capabilities add no computational or conceptual overhead costs. The language syntax is designed to be easy for people to audit for security flaws. For example, lexical scoping limits the amount of code that has to be examined for"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/1377046>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://erights.org/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.04xw5j"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1997"],"ns:type.object.name":["E"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125g34s5f"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.07sbkfb"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.02vmqtb"]}}
