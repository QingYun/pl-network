Arrays may have up to three dimensions, but dynamic bounds are not permitted. Additional types are records (called groups), tables, and overlay facilities.\\nControl structures include IF-THEN-ELSE, iteration, WHILE and CASE statements.\\nProcedures may have value parameters, quantity parameters - by reference without type-checking, parameterless procedure and label parameters.\\nThe TACPOL compiler ran on and generated code for the AN/GYK-12, a militarized version of the Litton Industries L-3050 32-bit minicomputer."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/1719114>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["TACPOL"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1255c4vfj"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
