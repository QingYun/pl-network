It has text processing abilities, such as regular expression matching. It provides many built-in numerical datatypes such as complex numbers and multi-dimensional numeric arrays, as well as their corresponding arithmetic operations. Support for multi-threaded programming is also an integrated part of Dao. The Dao interpreter is implemented as a lightweight virtual register machine (Dao VM) in standard C. The Dao VM can be extended with C or C++.\\nAdvanced features of the language include:\\nThe classic hello world program can be written as follows:\\nHere io(=stdio) is the standard library to handle input and output.\\nThe std.listmeth routine can be used to display the methods in a library. The methods in math, for example, can be displayed using:\\nA Dao variable can be implicitly declared by assigning the result of an expression to a variable name.\\nBy default, a variable will have a fixed type that is inferred from the expression that is used to declare the variable; this is called implicit typing. The type of a variable can also be specified explicitly, using the following"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/5731471>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2006"],"ns:type.object.name":["Dao Language"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1259r2y5b"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0jgqg"]}}
