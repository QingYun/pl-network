The language design was also influenced by the Mesa programming language and the new programming possibilities of the early personal computer Xerox Alto, both from Xerox, that Wirth saw during his 1976 sabbatical year at Xerox PARC.

In particular, it was designed to support separate compilation and data abstraction in a straightforward way. Much of the syntax is based on Wirth's earlier and better-known language, Pascal. Modula-2 was designed to be broadly similar to Pascal, with some elements and syntactic ambiguities removed and the important addition of the module concept, and direct language support for multiprogramming.\\nThe Modula-2 module may be"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/24102707>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1978"],"ns:type.object.name":["Modula-2"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125d69k_6"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.0fzlnq"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0q1x"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.0n6y"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.dialects":["ns:m.01xrtbk"]}}
