{"ns:m.0gdtn":{"rdfs:label":["A-0 System"],"ns:common.topic.description":["The A-0 system, written by Grace Hopper in 1951 and 1952 for the UNIVAC I, was the first compiler ever developed for an electronic computer. The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.\\nThe A-0 system was followed by the A-1, A-2, A-3, AT-3 and B-0.\\nThe A-2 system was developed at the UNIVAC division of Remington Rand in 1953 and released to customers by the end of that year. Customers were provided the source code for A-2 and invited to send their improvements back to UNIVAC. Thus A-2 was an early, and perhaps the first, example of free and open-source software."],"key:en":["a-0_programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.text":["The A-0 system (Arithmetic Language version 0), written by Grace Hopper in 1951 and 1952 for the UNIVAC I, was the first compiler ever developed for an electronic computer.
