It is a flow based programming language supporting message based constructs such as:\\nread/write/route/join/split.\\nThe language is built around integration of multiple systems, parallel and distributed execution.\\nResources can best be compared to variables in 3GLs a resource is identified by a URI.URIs can best be compared to types in Java they are (mostly) static, refer to actual resources and can provide functionality. Best, because Einstein is not a 3GL, similarities can be quite superficial.\\nURIs in Einstein are almost the same as standard URIs (with URLs as a subset), except they support two extra features:\\nMetadata - that is information which relates to a given provider (or scheme in URL/URI parlance). Nesting - a URI can have an indefinite amount of nesting.\\nSo a URI in Einstein could look like:\\n“cache(timeout=2000):dynamic(lang=groovy):jms(impl=RabbitMQ):$payload.destinationAddress”\\nAll data in Einstein takes the form of a message. A message contains a payload and associated metadata which relates to such concerns as routing, security and so on.
