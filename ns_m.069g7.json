QuakeC source code is compiled using a tool called qcc into a bytecode kept in a file called progs.dat. The programmers of Quake modifications could then publish their progs.dat bytecode without revealing their source code. Most Quake mods were published this way.\\nQuakeC allowed the Quake engine to dominate the direction of the first-person shooter genre.
