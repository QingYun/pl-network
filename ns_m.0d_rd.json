Nevertheless, a number of compilers have subsequently been written. A number of extensions to the original \\\"Befunge-93\\\" specification also exist, most notably Funge-98, which extends the concept to an arbitrary number of dimensions and can be multithreaded, with multiple instruction pointers operating simultaneously on the same space.
