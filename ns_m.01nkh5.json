It was designed by Intermetrics in the 1970s for NASA. HAL/S is written in XPL, a dialect of PL/I.\\nThe three key principles in designing the language were reliability, efficiency, and machine-independence. The language is designed to allow aerospace-related tasks (such as vector/matrix arithmetic) to be accomplished in a way that is easily understandable by people who have spaceflight knowledge, but may not necessarily have proficiency with computer programming.\\nHAL/S was designed not to include some constructs that are thought to be the cause of errors. For instance, there is no support for dynamic memory allocation. The language provides special support for real-time execution environments.\\nSome features, such as \\\"GOTO\\\" were provided chiefly to ease mechanical translations from other languages.\\nOn the Preface page of the HAL/S Language Specification, it says,\\n\\\"HAL\\\" was suggested as the name of the new language by Ed Copps, a founding director of Intermetrics, to honor Hal Laning, a colleague at MIT.\\nA proposal for a NASA standard"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/267538>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["HAL/S"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1258t5s3d"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.01qplz"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
