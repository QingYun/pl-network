It provides a set of guidelines for the structuring of specifications, which are expressed as models. Model-driven architecture is a kind of domain engineering, and supports model-driven engineering of software systems. It was launched by the Object Management Group (OMG) in 2001.\\nThe Model-Driven Architecture approach defines system functionality using a platform-independent model (PIM) using an appropriate domain-specific language (DSL).\\nThen, given a platform model corresponding to CORBA, .NET, the Web, etc., the PIM is translated to one or more platform-specific models (PSMs) that computers can run. This requires mappings and transformations and should be modeled too.\\nThe PSM may use different DSLs, or a General Purpose Language (GPL) like Java, C#, PHP, Python, etc.. Automated tools generally perform this translation.\\nThe OMG organization provides rough specifications rather than implementations, often as answers to Requests for Proposals (RFPs). Implementations come from private companies or open source groups.\\nMDA principles can also apply to other areas such as business"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/401169>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.description":["OMG Model Driven Architecture"],"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj32"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bkkrrx"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.omg.org/mda/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.023whs"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Model-driven architecture"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12567dxl3"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
