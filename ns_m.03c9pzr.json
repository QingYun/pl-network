Its originator and primary developer is software engineer James Jianbo Huang.  \\nJudoscript was one of the first general purpose scripting languages designed specifically for use with the Java platform.\\nJames Jianbo Huang originated Judoscript initially as a collection of several separate packages, libraries and Domain specific languages that he originated for use with the Java platform in J2EE Enterprise applications.\\nHuang designed and intended Judoscript and to provide a globally simple and intuitive scripting framework capable of leveraging the full suite of Java packages and third-party extensions to Java. The foundation of this design strategy was to provide an infrastructure: 1) with all the flexibility of a command shell; 2) with full interoperability and access to all facilities of Java; and 3) a simplified syntax that was intuitive to developers who are not necessarily Java programmers. \\nBecause of the design principles of Judoscript, Huang has stated that it is generally not suitable for Enterprise-scale application development, and is not intended to"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/13570551>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0blj_87"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://judoscript.org/home.html>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.03c9pzr"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2001-11"],"ns:type.object.name":["Judoscript"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12596b1xj"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.07sbkfb"]}}
