Though designed for game development, its flexibility has led to it being used for a variety of purposes, and to its evolution into the language Pike.\\nLPC syntax places it in the family of C-like languages, with C and C++ its strongest influences.\\nAlmost everything in LPC is an object. However, LPC does not precisely use the concept of a class (MudOS has something called a class, but it is really a struct). Instead, LPC objects are blueprint objects and clones of blueprint objects, in a prototype-based programming model. One can treat a blueprint object much as a class in other object-oriented languages.\\nEach object has variables (attributes) and functions (methods). The variables store the object's state; the functions are executable routines that can be called in the object. An object is uniquely defined by the name of the file in which it comes from, plus, if a clone, a numeric identifier. In a typical implementation, a clone of the file /lib/weapon.c which is the third clone created in the current run session will"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/904645>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["Lars Pensjö"],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://lpmuds.net/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.03nk21"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["LPC"],"rdf:type":["ns:user.kofish.default_domain.lpc_dialect"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125cqrb8x"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0jgqg"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.0gkc5"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.0lxk7"],"ns:computer.programming_language.dialects":["ns:m.0lxk7"]}}
