(They felt that other existing languages such as C++ and their environments were far too complicated for beginners.) The programming language that they created was called SiMPLE.\\nSiMPLE is vaguely reminiscent of the AppleSoft BASIC programming language that existed on the old Apple-II computers. However, SiMPLE is not (and was never intended to be) merely a \\\"clone\\\" of Applesoft BASIC. It was merely \\\"inspired\\\" by it. There are many features of Applesoft that needed to be improved. For example, Applesoft was an interpreted language, and so it ran somewhat slowly (even for a 1MHZ processor). SiMPLE, on the other hand, compiles into an executable (.EXE) file. So it not only produces programs that run faster, but those programs can even run on computers that don't have SiMPLE"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/39282074>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["SiMPLE"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125c74ms8"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
