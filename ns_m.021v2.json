The specification defines an environment that allows multiple high-level languages to be used on different computer platforms without being rewritten for specific architectures.\\nAmong other things, the CLI specification describes the following four aspects:\\nAll compatible languages compile to Common Intermediate Language (CIL), which is an intermediate language that is abstracted from the platform hardware. When the code is executed, the platform-specific VES will compile the CIL to the machine language according to the specific hardware and operating system.\\nIn August 2000, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, and others worked to standardize CLI. By December 2001, it was ratified by the ECMA, with ISO standardization following in April 2003.\\nMicrosoft and its partners hold patents for CLI.
