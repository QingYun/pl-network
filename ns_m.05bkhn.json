It added implicit file handling capabilities and was influential on MUMPS.\\nFilecomp or FileComp was a type composition language that ran on the RCA Spectra 1600 computer attached to the RCA Graphic Services Division (GSD) VideoComp CRT typesetter.\\nThe VideoComp was developed by Dr. Rudolf Hell of Kiel, Germany, as the Digiset, and marketed by RCA GSD in the U.S. in the late 1960s and early 1970s as the VideoComp. When RCA got out of the computer business, support of the VideoComp was taken over by Information International, Inc. or Triple I.\\nFilecomp resembled an odd mix of Fortran, Cobol, Assembly and RCA GSD Page-1 Composition Languages.
