It is a proprietary software product of Stilo International.\\nOmniMark is used to convert data from one format to another. In many respects it is similar to the Perl language. It has a built-in XML parser, which has made it popular. It has support for XQuery via integration with Sedna native XML database. It also has features to process find rules which implement a similar concept to regular expressions, although the pattern expression syntax is quite different from the more familiar regular expression syntax used in Perl and other languages. Its syntax is English-like and hence it is easy to understand. Although it is Perl's competitor, Perl and the Ruby programming language are more widely used than OmniMark, because they are open source and freely distributed. OmniMark can also be used for schema transformation tasks in the same way as XSLT, but allows straightforward paradigm switching between procedural and functional code without the need for any additional constructs to support the procedural elements. In general OmniMark is significantly faster to write than XSLT for any given"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/3375679>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["OmniMark"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1259rwqm1"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
