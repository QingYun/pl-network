It uses a 4GL known as WLanguage. The tools enables a predetermined set of standard forms and algorithms to be used in an automated fashion to generate applications (RAD). The source code is precompiled and interpreted at run time like Visual Basic, Java or C#. This makes the executable program independent from the operating system and allows dynamic compilation as well as instant testing during development. WinDev was originally conceived as a CASE tool for writing Windows applications. Since version 16, WinDev can be used for writing native Linux applications.\\nWinDev is a development environment aimed at rapid development of data-centric applications. Its integrated set of editors allow development of prototypes that can then be converted into full-fledged applications. WinDev can generate applications in Java along with standard applications or applications for the .NET platform. It supports procedural as well as object-oriented programming paradigms.\\nIts companion products, WebDev and WinDev Mobile, share"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/8282122>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bkjxyy"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.windev.com/pcsoft/resellers/index.html>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.026yxgb"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["WinDev"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1258jnbz4"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
