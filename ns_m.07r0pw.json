It also provides facilities for structures and multi-dimensional arrays. Both typed and untyped pointers are also supported, along with typecasting.\\nPEARL is a higher programming language, which allows a comfortable, secure and almost processor independent programming of multitasking- and realtime problems and has been standardized since 1977 at various stages of its development, the last time 1998 as PEARL-90 (DIN 66253-2 1998, Berlin, Beuth-Verlag, 1998).\\nBesides the simple possibility to map process technical problems, an important principle at the"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/2603123>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["PEARL"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1256z3w5_"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
