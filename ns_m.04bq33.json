While not as popular as Inform or TADS, it is still used, particularly for multimedia interactive fiction (as opposed to strict text adventures).\\nThe Hugo language is a hybrid of several features to provide a command processing system. The system consists of a verb definition section, a property and attribute definition section, an object definition section, and a code section. One may assign multiple names to the same attribute or property through the alias parameter to an attribute or property.\\nThe language is not case sensitive, although much of the code base in the standard library uses camel case for identifiers. Identifiers must start with a letter, and may contain letters, numbers and underscores. Strings are defined by using a double quote. Where it is necessary to include a double quote in a string, it may be escaped by preceding it with a backslash, i.e. \\\\\\\" . With the exception of quoted strings, lines must be explicitly marked as being continued by having the last character on the line to be a backslash.\\nThe system provides for procedures, called a \\\"routine\\\" which may"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/1151504>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Hugo"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1256qn_6s"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05yd5"]}}
