The first version was published as BASIC/Z. Later, it was distributed by Borland as Turbo Basic, and since 1989, it has been known as PowerBASIC.\\nThe first version was published as BASIC/Z, the very first interactive compiler for CP/M and MDOS. Later, it was extended to MS-DOS/PC-DOS, and in 1987, Borland published it as Turbo Basic. In 1990, it was reborn as PowerBASIC. \\nPowerBASIC programs are self-contained and do not need a runtime file to execute.
