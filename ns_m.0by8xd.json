Public archives have dated Mudlle to around 1993, although it was not available during that year and has since been released with the original dates from the readme files intact. It had several design aims:\\nIt should be simple and small. This translates into a simple compiler/interpreter, less bugs, and faster availability.\\nIt should be easy to use.\\nIt should be safe, i.e. bugs in programs written by gods should not crash the game. They are likely to cause strange behaviour, but this is more or less unavoidable.\\nMudlle is similar to LPMud's solution for scripted actions, specialized objects, and simulations.
