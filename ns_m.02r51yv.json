It was developed in Sun Microsystems Laboratories by David Allison and released as open source in September 2003. It is a dynamically typed, object-oriented language with built-in multithreading. In some respects it is similar in functionality to Python, Perl, JavaScript and Java. Syntactically it is very similar to C++ and Java.\\nFull documentation for the Aikido language is available in the Programmers reference manual\\nThe name Aikido refers to the Japanese martial art of the same name and was chosen because the language, like the martial art is derived from many other parts, taking the most desirable aspects of each. The original name for the Aikido language was Darwin but this was such a common name that it was unavailable for use by Sun.\\nThe original use for Aikido was as the control language for an assembler for an internal experimental simulation project within Sun Microsystems Laboratories. The language run-time system still maintains the hooks necessary to make it into a control language.\\nModern scripting languages are used for many tasks ranging from control of"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/11250067>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2003"],"ns:type.object.name":["Aikido Programming Language"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1257xhvrc"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0n6y"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
