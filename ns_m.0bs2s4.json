It is a dialect of Standard ML, augmented with support for lazy evaluation, concurrency (multithreading and distributed computing via remote procedure calls) and constraint programming.\\nAlice extends Standard ML in a number of ways that distinguish it from its predecessor. Alice provides concurrency features as part of the base language through the use of a “future” type that represents a value being provided by an independent thread of execution. A thread that uses a future value will block on an attempt to access the value until the thread performing it has completed the computation. A related concept is also provided known as a \\\"promise\\\", allowing a thread to provide a future value that it will compute to another thread. Future and promise typed variables are used to implement data-flow synchronization.\\nAlice also provides facilities to allow programmers to use a lazy evaluation strategy in their programs versus the traditional eager evaluation strategy that Standard ML takes. The Haskell language is a functional language that also provides lazy evaluation.
