However, weaknesses in this design have been found that make it possible (though still very difficult) to write Malbolge programs in an organized fashion.\\nMalbolge was so difficult to understand when it arrived that it took two years for the first Malbolge program to appear. The program was not even written by a human being: it was generated by a beam search algorithm designed by Andrew Cooke and implemented in Lisp.\\nLater, Lou Scheffer posted a cryptanalysis of Malbolge and provided a program to copy its input to its output.\\nOlmstead believed Malbolge to be a linear bounded automaton. There is a more interesting discussion about whether one can implement sensible loops in Malbolge â€” it took many years before the first non-terminating one was introduced.
