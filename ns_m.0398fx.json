{"ns:m.0398fx":{"ns:common.topic.description":["Property Specification Language is a temporal logic extending Linear temporal logic with a range of operators for both ease of expression and enhancement of expressive power. PSL makes an extensive use of regular expressions and syntactic sugaring. It is widely used in the hardware design and verification industry, where formal verification tools and/or logic simulation tools are used to prove or refute that a given PSL formula holds on a given design.\\nPSL was initially developed by Accellera for specifying properties or assertions about hardware designs. Since September 2004 the standardization on the language has been done in IEEE 1850 working group.
