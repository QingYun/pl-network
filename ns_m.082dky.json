The aim is to enable users to create computer software without directly coding in a texture programming language. It can be extended by software developers.\\nIn the future most people should be able to do computer programming. Visual and codeless programming can be one of possible ways to reach that goal.\\nWhen events were added to classes it enabled rapid application development, especially the visual development of graphic user interface. But event handling is still expressed via textual programming languages.\\nThe idea of Limnor codeless programming is to add \\\"Actions\\\" to classes. Adding actions to classes eliminates the need of textual programming languages, making generic purpose codeless and visual programming possible without sacrificing programming power.\\nA class in Object-Oriented Programming is defined by properties, methods and events. Now it is enhanced by actions.\\nVisual programming by \\\"properties, methods, events and actions\\\" can be a fifth-generation programming language.\\nPeople expect 5GL to be easy to use, to be visual. There are many excellent visual programming languages and systems available now."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/2782804>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Limnor"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1258b79qj"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
