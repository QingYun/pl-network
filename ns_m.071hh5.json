The only known implementation of the language is written in Java and is intended for embedding into existing Java applications to provide scripting services.\\nThe Sleep Java API allows the language to be extended with new constructs, operators, functions, and variable containers, making it easy to integrate it into applications.\\nSleep is currently utilized in the IRC client jIRCii and the IRC bot SleepyBot.\\nSleep first version appeared in a week-end of coding in April 2002. Since then Sleep has been developed in parallel with a Java IRC Client which heavily uses its features called jIRCii. The current stable 2.1 version is available since July 2008.\\nSleep is very easy to learn in its basic form, and anyone familiar with Perl or PHP will feel right at home. In addition to being embeddable, Sleep can also be used stand-alone on the command line or using an interactive shell.\\nSleep has native support for three widely different data types: scalars, arrays, and hashes. Scalars are prefixed with a dollar sign ($), arrays with 'at'-signs (@) and hashes with"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/2293454>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2002"],"ns:type.object.name":["Sleep programming language"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125b5xr5j"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.05zrn"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05yd5"]}}
