Moreover, Java scripting languages were largely non-existent at that time: Groovy and JRuby had not yet been invented and Jython had just been created in late 1997. Browsers in 1998 had limited feature sets, were too unstable for production use in an 8-hour shift and were still fighting skirmishes in the Browser Wars. In this environment, Yoix technology was created in response to a pressing need for a reliable, easy to distribute and maintain, GUI front-end for a mission-critical application being developed within AT&T, namely its Global Fraud Management System, which to this day monitors and"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/2248859>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2000"],"ns:type.object.name":["Yoix"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125715gbw"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05yd5"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.07sbkfb"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
