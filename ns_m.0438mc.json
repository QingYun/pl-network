Store and Yahoo! Site web hosting services.\\nThe language originated at Viaweb, a company founded in 1995 by Paul Graham and Robert T. Morris, as the template language for their e-commerce platform. RTML stands for \\\"Robert T. Morris Language\\\". The RTML editor was offered as an option for customers (usually small businesses) who wanted to customize their online stores more than the built-in templates allowed. The built-in templates were also written in RTML, and provided the starting point for most people who used the language.\\nIn 1998, Yahoo! bought Viaweb for $49.6 million and renamed the service Yahoo!
