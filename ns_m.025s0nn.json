Over the years since, he has written several essays describing features or goals of the language, and some internal projects at Y Combinator have been written in Arc, most notably the Hacker News web forum and news aggregator program.\\nIn the essay Being Popular Graham describes a few of his goals for the language. Among the claimed design goals are that \\\"Arc should be hackable\\\" and \\\"there should be good libraries\\\"; Graham also proposes:\\nIt would not be far from the truth to say that a hacker about to write a program decides what language to use, at least subconsciously, based on the total number of characters he'll have to type. If this isn't precisely how hackers think, a language designer would do well to act as if it were.\\nPaul Graham suggests John McCarthy's original Lisp to have been built wholly on a small set of \\\"axioms\\\", and maintains that Arc ought to be constructed in a similar way, even when that means the language may not have features that large organizations want.
