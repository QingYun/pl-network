NumPy is open source and has many contributors.\\nBecause Python is currently implemented as an interpreter, mathematical algorithms written in it often run much more slowly than compiled equivalents. Numpy seeks to address this problem for numerical algorithms by providing multidimensional arrays and functions and operators that operate efficiently on arrays. Thus any algorithm that can be expressed primarily as operations on arrays and matrices can run almost as quickly as the equivalent C code.\\nUsing NumPy in Python gives functionality comparable to MATLAB since they are both interpreted, and they both allow the user to write fast programs as long as most operations work on arrays or matrices instead of scalars.
