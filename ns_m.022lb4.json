Except for some standard modules, Jython programs use Java classes instead of Python modules. Jython includes almost all of the modules in the standard Python programming language distribution, lacking only some of the modules implemented originally in C. For example, a user interface in Jython could be written with Swing, AWT or SWT. Jython compiles to Java bytecode (intermediate language) either on demand or statically.\\nJim Hugunin created Jython in late 1997, initially to be able to replace C with Java for performance-intensive code accessed by Python programs, and developed it until 1999. In February 1999, Barry Warsaw took over as the primary developer. In October 2000, Jython moved to SourceForge.\\nFor a long time, Samuele Pedroni did most of the work to maintain and develop Jython. At the end of 2004, Pedroni stepped down as the primary developer to concentrate his effort on PyPy, but he is still considered the authority on Jython internals. In January 2005, Brian Zimmer received a grant from the Python Software Foundation"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/390263>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.developers":["Jim Hugunin"],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.jython.org/>"],"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bkvb6j"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.022lb4"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Jython"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12552sqnn"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.05z1_"]}}
