These were the first commercially available parallel processing computers, originally referred to as \\\"mini-computers\\\". Tandem's strategy was the emerging concept of \\\"continuous availability\\\" that relied on mirrored disks, their controllers and software, and a well engineered operating system (Guardian, and later NonStop Kernel or NSK) to ensure continuous application availability by ensuring the system could survive any single point of hardware failure. The company was bought out in 1999 by Compaq Computers, and several years later by Hewlett Packard Computers.
