UCSD Pascal was first released in 1978. It was developed at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).\\nUCSD Pascal was developed at The University of California, San Diego Institute for Information Systems in 1978 to provide students with a common operating system that could run on any of the then available microcomputers as well as campus DEC PDP-11 minicomputers. UCSD p-System (Version IV, supplied by SofTech) was one of three operating systems (along with PC-DOS and CP/M-86) that IBM offered for its original IBM PC; but the p-System never sold very well for the IBM PC, mainly because of a lack of applications and because it was more expensive than the other choices. Previously, IBM had offered the UCSD p-System as an option for Displaywriter, an 8086-based dedicated word processing machine (not to be confused with IBM's DisplayWrite word processing software.) (The Displaywriter's native operating system had been developed completely internally and was not opened for end-user programming.)\\nNotable extensions to standard Pascal include"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/31925>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["UCSD Pascal"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12598rw3q"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.05y49"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.05y49"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.07sbkfb"]}}
