With Xbase++ it is possible to generate applications for Windows NT, 95, 98, Me, 2000, XP, VISTA and Windows 7.\\nXBase++ supports the old commands @SAY/GET to define data entry forms as well as a graphic editor to create data entry forms similar to Visual Foxpro. It also has a visual development environment, support for OEM files (DOS format) and ANSI (Windows), an integrated debugger and a resource compiler to add icons and graphics to the application. It can generate EXE or DLL files.\\nXbase++ supports the Replaceable Database Drivers (RDD, which provide access to multiple database formats) of Clipper through the DatabaseEngines (DBEs). The basic package includes support for DBF, FOX, NTX, CDX, SDF and DEL(delimited). It also supports CORBA 2.0, Visual FoxPro 3.0 to 5.0 database formats, and access to SQL servers.\\nXBase++ was born after the decision of"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/2924800>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.image":[{"ns:type.content.blob_id":["8e6ff638baa0d99f6800be91fc21298e70360e8eddb2a1474d843f7597c81812"],"ns:type.content.length":["94007"],"rdfs:label":["Animals"],"ns:common.image.rights_holder_text_attribution":["Attributed to wikipedia user DutiesAtHand"],"ns:type.content.uploaded_by":["ns:m.0220tm0"],"ns:type.content.language":["ns:m.04l"],"ns:common.licensed_object.license":["ns:m.05smz"],"ns:type.content.media_type":["ns:m.08y0"],"ns:common.image.size":["ns:m.0gzj_g6"],"ns:type.content.source":["ns:m.0gzj_gw"],"ns:type.object.name":["Animals"],"rdf:type":["ns:type.content"],"ns:common.image.appears_in_topic_gallery":["ns:m.08czsn"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["XBase++"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125f2j2yp"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
