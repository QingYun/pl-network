Its stiffest competition at Bell Labs is the language C, which is higher level, and machine independent. Every time it looked like C was too expensive to use for a particular project, LIL was considered. But almost every time, it proved easier to improve C, or its runtime support, or the hardware, than to invest time in yet another language. ... A machine independent language is always superior -- even for writing machine dependent code -- so long as the overhead can be endured."],"rdfs:label":["Little Implementation Language"],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.text":["LIL, the Little Implementation Language, was a system programming language during the early days of Unix history on PDP-11 machines.
