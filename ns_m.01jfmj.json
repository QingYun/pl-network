Aspects can contain several entities unavailable to standard classes. These are:\\nAspectJ also supports limited forms of pointcut-based static checking and aspect reuse (by inheritance). See the AspectJ Programming Guide for a more detailed description of the language.\\nAspectJ has been designed to be implemented in many ways, including source- or bytecode-weaving and directly in the VM (virtual machine). In all cases, the AspectJ program is transformed into a valid Java program run in a Java VM. Any classes affected by aspects are binary-compatible with the unaffected classes (in order to maintain"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/237214>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bljbr7"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.01jfmj"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["AspectJ"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1259gdgr9"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
