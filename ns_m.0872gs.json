All useful operators and data types, like integers or addition, are defined in the standard library (XL2). XL1 is portable between different execution environments. There is no such guarantee for XL2: if a particular CPU does not implement floating-point multiplication, the corresponding operator definition may be missing from the standard library, and using a floating-point multiply may result in a compile-time error.\\nThe Hello World program in XL looks like the following:\\nAn alternative form in a style more suitable for large-scale programs would be:\\nA recursive implementation of factorial in XLR looks like"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/2855241>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://xlr.sf.net>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.0872gs"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2000"],"ns:type.object.name":["XL"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125crz21j"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.01c3bz"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0n6y"]}}
