Arguably, few languages today are expressive and concise enough to be used as thinking tools.\\nSuperPascal is based on Niklaus Wirth's sequential language Pascal, extending it with features for safe and efficient concurrency. Pascal itself was used heavily as a publication language in the 1970s; it was used to teach structured programming practices and featured in text books, for example, on compilers and programming languages. Brinch Hansen had earlier developed the language Concurrent Pascal, one of the earliest concurrent languages for the design of operating systems and real-time control systems.\\nThe requirements of SuperPascal were based on the experience gained by Brinch Hansen over three years in developing a set of model parallel"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/25308175>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1993"],"ns:type.object.name":["SuperPascal"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1yl5lhxtb"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.06w_b"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0bxzs64"]}}
