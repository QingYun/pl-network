Ubercode has the following design goals:\\nCompilable language - compiled into Windows EXE files.\\nAutomatic memory management - memory is allocated / freed automatically, and the language has no memory management primitives.\\nPre and post conditions - these are run-time assertions which are attached to function declarations, as in Eiffel.\\nHigh-level data types - resizable arrays, lists and tables may contain arbitrary components.\\nIntegrated file handling - primitives for transparent handling of text, binary, CSV, XML and dBase files.\\nEase of use - language structure is relatively simple, making the language accessible to beginners."],"rdfs:label":["Ubercode"],"key:en":["ubercode"],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.text":["Ubercode is a high level programming language designed by Ubercode Software and released in 2005 for Microsoft Windows.
