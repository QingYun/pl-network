A very important feature is the ability to extend (not just inherit from) existing classes, like Objective-C Categories. This considerably reduces the need for the Abstract Factory Pattern, which complicates using Application Frameworks in Java and C++. Realbasic also includes delegates, introspection, and namespace support, which allows modules to contain classes, interfaces and other modules.\\nAs described in the language reference, its built-in framework supports (Real Software 2011) :\\nThe framework functionality can also be extended by creating plugins using the Plugin SDK provided by Real Software.
