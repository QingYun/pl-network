It is best known for its use as a page description language in the electronic and desktop publishing areas.\\nThe concepts of the PostScript language were seeded in 1976 when John Warnock was working at Evans & Sutherland, a computer graphics company. At that time John Warnock was developing an interpreter for a large three-dimensional graphics database of New York harbor. Warnock conceived the Design System language to process the graphics.\\nConcurrently, researchers at Xerox PARC had developed the first laser printer and had recognized the need for a standard means of defining page images. In 1975-76 Bob Sproull and William Newman developed the Press format, which was eventually used in the Xerox Star system to drive laser printers. But Press, a data format rather than a language, lacked flexibility, and PARC mounted the InterPress effort to create a successor.\\nIn 1978 Evans and Sutherland asked Warnock to move from the San Francisco Bay Area to their main headquarters in Utah, but he was not interested in moving. He then joined Xerox PARC to work with"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/24080>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1982"],"ns:type.object.name":["PostScript"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125fjp_7c"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.04kyw"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05yd5"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.06z3b2"]}}
