Unlike machine code, Short Code statements represented mathematic expressions rather than a machine instruction.\\nShort Code was proposed by John Mauchly in 1949 and originally known as Brief Code. William Schmitt implemented a version of Brief Code in 1949 for the BINAC computer, though it was never debugged and tested. The following year Schmitt implemented a new version of Brief Code for the UNIVAC I where it was now known as Short Code (also Short Order Code). A revised version of Short Code was developed in 1952 for the Univac II by A. B. Tonik and J. R Logan.\\nWhile Short Code represented expressions, the representation itself was not direct and required a process of manual conversion. Elements of an expression were represented by two-character codes and then divided into 6-code groups in order to conform to the 12 byte words used by BINAC and Univac computers. For example the expression:\\nwas converted to Short Code by a sequence of substitutions and a final regrouping:\\nAlong with basic arithmetic, Short Code allowed for branching and calls to a library of functions.
