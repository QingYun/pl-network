That is to say, VHDL was developed as an alternative to huge, complex manuals which were subject to implementation-specific details.\\nThe idea of being able to simulate this documentation was so obviously attractive that logic simulators were developed that could read the VHDL files. The next step was the development of logic synthesis tools that read the VHDL, and output a definition of the physical implementation of the circuit.\\nDue to the Department of Defense requiring as much of the syntax as possible to be based on Ada, in order to avoid re-inventing concepts that had already been thoroughly tested in the development of Ada, VHDL borrows heavily from the Ada programming language in both concepts and syntax.\\nThe initial version of VHDL, designed to IEEE standard 1076-1987, included a"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/43410>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["VHDL"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125g_q9jx"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0n6y"]}}
