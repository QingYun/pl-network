The NetLogo environment enables exploration of emergent phenomena. It comes with an extensive models library including models in a variety of domains such as economics, biology, physics, chemistry, psychology, system dynamics and many other natural and social sciences. Beyond exploration, NetLogo enables the quick and easy authoring of models.\\nIt is particularly well suited for modeling complex systems developing over time. Modelers can give instructions to hundreds or thousands of independent \\\"agents\\\" all operating concurrently. This makes it possible to explore the connection between the micro-level behavior of individuals and the macro-level patterns that emerge from the interaction of many individuals.\\nNetLogo has many thousands of active users. It is freely available from the NetLogo website. NetLogo is in use in a wide variety of educational contexts from elementary school to graduate school.
