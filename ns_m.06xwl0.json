Originally shipped with the popular Internet Factory's Commerce Builder software, it has been ported as an Apache module.\\nSMX was designed to embed macros in HTML/XML pages. It originally shipped with the Internet Factory's Commerce Builder software, a relatively popular web server in the early days of the Internet, due to the ease with which a developer could produce an e-commerce website.\\nRather than re-implement websites in more popular languages, like Perl or PHP, a small group of SMX fans decided to re-implement the language itself as an Apache module.\\nA good example of a macro is %counter(). This embeds a simple incremental counter on an HTML page. To include the results of a SQL query on a page, you can simply type %sql(<dsn>,<query>,%col(1)<br />) in the middle of an XHTML page.\\nOwing to the high-level nature of the language, SMX can greatly reduce the programming effort required to build dynamic or database-driven web sites.\\nUnlike many programming languages, SMX syntax is simple and consistent.
