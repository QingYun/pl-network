The earliest version was implemented on the prototype USQ-17 computer (called \\\"the Countess\\\") at the laboratory. It was the world's first self-compiling compiler. This means that the compiler was first coded in simplified form in assembly language \\\"the bootstrap\\\", and then re-written in its own language, compiled by this \\\"bootstrap\\\" compiler, and re-compiled by itself, making the \\\"bootstrap\\\" obsolete.\\nIt is called a variant of ALGOL 58 because of similarities to that language, but, shortly after the ALGOL committee produced other versions of ALGOL, and NELIAC and ALGOL parted ways.\\nThe compiler was used on the Countess to produce a version for the CDC 1604, and later self-compiled on"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/949068>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["NELIAC"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125btrl_3"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
