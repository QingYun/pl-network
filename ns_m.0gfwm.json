It is heavily influenced by the Self programming language, but modified to be more suited to needs of mobile and embedded devices.\\nTraditional computers, at least in the desktop role, have two modes; \\\"on\\\" and \\\"off\\\". When moving from one mode to the other the state of the machine is lost from memory, and requires a sometimes lengthy \\\"boot\\\" process to return the machine to the \\\"on\\\" state. This does not suffice for a PDA type device where the user expects the machine to be available almost instantly for taking down quick notes. Yet a machine cannot be left \\\"on\\\" for any length of time either, as this would drain the battery too much to make it useful for carrying around.\\nIn the Newton platform, the system had two states that were more like \\\"on\\\" and \\\"sleeping\\\". When moving to the sleeping state the memory was not lost and instead the system simply stopped working on the contents of memory, which allowed for many of the chips inside to be turned off. This greatly extended battery life, yet still allowed the machine to turn back on almost instantly.\\nWith the main memory always being"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/60545>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.developers":["Apple Inc."],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["Apple Inc."],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1993"],"ns:type.object.name":["NewtonScript"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1258_s7w5"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.040ysg"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0gd42"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.0gkc5"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.0gd42"]}}
