PLEXIL has been used to demonstrate automation technologies targeted at future NASA space missions. Applications of PLEXIL have included control of hardware prototypes (planetary rovers and drills, the Habitat Demonstration Unit, and procedure automation for the International Space Station.\\nThe binaries and documentation are widely available as open source from Sourceforge.net .\\nThe fundamental programming unit of PLEXIL is the Node. A node is a data structure formed of two primary components: a set of conditions that drive the execution of the node and another set which specifies what the node accomplishes after execution.\\nA hierarchical composition of nodes is called a plan. A plan is a tree divided in nodes close to the root (high level nodes) and leaf nodes that represent primitive actions such"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/19189627>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0blq5pd"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://plexil.sourceforge.net/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.04lj88t"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2005"],"ns:type.object.name":["PLEXIL"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125f2txc9"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.01h1_2"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
