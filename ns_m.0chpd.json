Lua has a relatively simple C API compared to other scripting languages.\\nLua was created in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes, members of the Computer Graphics Technology Group (Tecgraf) at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil.\\nFrom 1977 until 1992, Brazil had a policy of strong trade barriers (called a market reserve) for computer hardware and software. In that atmosphere, Tecgraf's clients could not afford, either politically or financially, to buy customized software from abroad. Those reasons led Tecgraf to implement from scratch the basic tools it needed.\\nLua's historical \\\"father and mother\\\" were data-description/configuration languages SOL (Simple Object Language) and DEL (data-entry language).
