The programming environment consists of a compiler, virtual machine (garbage collector and JIT compiler) along with a command line debugger.\\nThe programming environment originally grew from a prototype that was created in 2008 to investigate the process of translating stack VM instructions into register instructions and finally into machine code. From that prototype, a small virtual machine was developed called StackVM along with a simple assembler. The project adopted the name Objeck after the assembler was replaced by a the current language frontend.\\nObjeck has ties with C#, Scheme and Pascal. Today the system is generally considered stable and performance is comparable to languages like Java. Current development is focused on adding new features such as ODBC support and tuning the virtual machine.\\nSome of the current features include:\\nBelow is an example of the \\\"Hello world\\\" program:"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/28646377>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0gb5lzy"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.0cz9tkr"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://sourceforge.net/projects/objeck-lang>"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2008"],"ns:type.object.name":["Objeck"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12568b7rs"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.06w_b"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.07sbkfb"]}}
