Its main benefit was allowing faster application development on the order of 6 to 10 times faster than doing a system using a 3GL, such as COBOL. MARK IV, being an early 4GL, allowed user development of systems related to business. In an 1971 ad by Informatics, there are several quotes from customers, such as:\\nWe conservatively estimate that the benefits derived from the MARK IV System have completely returned the cost of our investment in a period of less than 3 months.\\nMARK IV runs ... handle Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Sales Analyses, etc. on about 26 different factories.\\nMARK IV is now part of the product suite from Computer Associates."],"rdfs:label":["MARK IV"],"key:en":["mark_iv"],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.text":["MARK-IV is a Fourth-generation programming language that was created by Informatics, Inc. in the 1960s.
