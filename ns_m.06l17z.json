Software developers use Lazarus to create native-code console and graphical user interface applications for the desktop, and also for mobile devices, web applications, web services, visual components and function libraries. The Free Pascal compiler supports a number of different platforms, such as Mac, Linux and Windows.\\nLazarus inherits three features from its use of the Free Pascal compiler: compile and execution speed, and cross-compilation. The Free Pascal compiler benefits from the Pascal language structure and the steady advancements of the Pascal compiler design to compile large applications quickly, often in a matter of seconds. When compiling reference programs for performance metrics, Lazarus produces programs that exhibit near or similar performance when compared with the same programs written in C.\\nAn application that developers create using Lazarus on one platform can potentially compile and execute on any platform for which a Free Pascal compiler exists."],"rdfs:label":["Lazarus"],"ns:common.topic.official_website":["<http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/>"],"ns:common.topic.image":[{"ns:type.content.length":["375932"],"ns:type.content.blob_id":["556e7ef40ce8bb5f8ffec4b618058fd6e0bcd7ed8ff679fb1b1057f34cdee90d"],"ns:common.licensed_object.provenance":["wikipedia,commons,947914"],"ns:type.content.source":["ns:m.02chjhl"],"ns:common.image.size":["ns:m.02chjhx"],"ns:common.licensed_object.license":["ns:m.034jd"],"ns:type.content.media_type":["ns:m.08y0"],"ns:type.object.name":["Lazarus"],"rdfs:label":["Lazarus"],"rdf:type":["ns:type.content"],"ns:common.image.appears_in_topic_gallery":["ns:m.06l17z"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bm1rh_"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.06l17z"]}],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.text":["Lazarus is a free cross-platform IDE which provides a Delphi-like development experience for Pascal and Object Pascal developers. It is developed for, and supported by, the Free Pascal compiler. Since early 2008, Lazarus has been available for Microsoft Windows, several Linux distributions, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X. The earliest versions were created before that, and Lazarus is a front end for the much older Free Pascal.\\nLazarus uses Free Pascal as its back-end compiler. Therefore Lazarus can, theoretically, be used to develop applications for all platforms supported by Free Pascal.\\nSimilar to Free Pascalâ€™s run-time library, Lazarus provides a cross-platform application framework called the Lazarus Component Library (LCL), which provides a single, unified interface for programmers, with different platform-specific implementations. Using LCL, one can create applications in a write once, compile anywhere manner, unless system-dependent features are used explicitly.\\nAs Free Pascal supports cross-compiling, Lazarus applications can be cross-compiled from Windows to Linux and FreeBSD, and vice versa. Compiling from Mac OS X to Windows, Linux and FreeBSD is possible.
