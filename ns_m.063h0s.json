Harbour has been actively maintained, adding features while still keeping backward-compatible with Clipper style. It has undergone many changes and revisions and regain widely popularity amongst programmers in 1980s and 1990s.\\nThe open source Harbour license is similar to the GNU General Public License, with an exception supporting proprietary applications, so proprietary applications can be produced with Harbour and distributed.\\nThe idea of a free software Clipper compiler had been floating around for a long time and the subject has often cropped up in discussion on comp.lang.clipper.
