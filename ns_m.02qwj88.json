It supports both object-oriented and imperative programming paradigms, as well as some simple functional aspects.\\nDistributed under the licence of zlib/libpng, MiniD is free software.\\nMiniD began in June 2006 as an idea for a statically-typed language, much like a stripped-down version of the D programming language. This is the reason for the name \\\"MiniD\\\". After work began on the compiler, the creator, Jarrett Billingsley, realized just how large a project this language was becoming, and decided to recast the language into something simpler to implement. The result was a Lua-like language with a C-style syntax. Over the next several months, MiniD acquired features from various languages, such as Squirrel-like classes, a D-like module system, and Lua-like collaborative multithreading. On August 1, 2007, after more than thirteen months of planning and programming, version 1.0 of the reference implementation was released. The version 1.0 language specification is frozen.\\nAs of June 15, 2009, version 2 of MiniD has"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/10965409>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bm0m8_"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://www.dsource.org/projects/minid>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.02qwj88"]}],"ns:common.topic.image":[{"ns:type.content.length":["11100"],"rdfs:label":["Minidlogo2"],"ns:type.content.blob_id":["f02294607c946372829943fd47b89b147589334ed67d22faacdaf98240a72754"],"ns:common.image.size":["ns:m.01x3ygw"],"ns:type.content.source":["ns:m.03r0v3j"],"ns:common.licensed_object.license":["ns:m.05smz"],"ns:type.content.media_type":["ns:m.08y0"],"ns:type.object.name":["Minidlogo2"],"rdf:type":["ns:type.content"],"ns:common.image.appears_in_topic_gallery":["ns:m.02qwj88"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["2006"],"ns:type.object.name":["MiniD"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125gbh0nk"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.0chpd"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
