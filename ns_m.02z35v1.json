It started out at the MIT and Harvard Biomedical Engineering Centre in Boston, (part of the Health, Science and Technology Division) and was written in the mid 1970s by Jonathan Sachs. Jonathan Sachs went on to be the principal programmer of Lotus Development and wrote the first version of Lotus 1-2-3.\\nThe original version of STOIC was written on a Data General Nova minicomputer and cross-assembled for the 8080. STOIC came with its own primitive but effective file system, and could be booted up with little preliminary work on any 8080-based microprocessor with 24K of memory and a Teletype machine. After the source was released into the public domain, the system was subsequently modified to run under CP/M.  STOIC was said at the time  'to be conceptually similar to FORTH in the use of an extensible vocabulary of words'. . STOIC is actually a rational, and more consistent, dialect of FORTH. The system was remarkable at the time for having a built-in assembler, floating-point package, interrupt handler, and display editor (similar to the Nova display editor).
