It was originally developed by Tim Thompson and released by AT&T.\\nTim Thompson is a software engineer and the originator of various software titles, including Keykit and Stevie (predecessor of the now widely-distributed and popular text editor Vim). Keykit (originally named \\\"Keynote\\\") was developed by Thompson in his spare time while he worked for AT&T, though it was not related to his actual job there. Keynote was originally released through the AT&T Toolchest, and in 1995 was released as KeyKit with a license making it freely available for non-commercial use.\\nKeykit is noteworthy for its versatility and expressiveness. Complex algorthmic arrangements can be produced with as much detail and sophistication as required, and the software works on multiple platforms and operating systems. It is not dependent on peripherals or sound cards from a specific vendor. These are unique advantages over similar \\\"music workstation\\\" products with the same or similar functionality for algorithmic composition and computer generated music.\\nFeatures:"],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/8241243>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj5d"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bl81gr"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://nosuch.com/keykit>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.026xgmc"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Keykit"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125cz1n10"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"]}}
