It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.\\nIt is designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers, performance-critical applications, and entertainment software. C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms and provided by various organizations, including the FSF, LLVM, Microsoft and Intel.\\nC++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization, with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2014 as ISO/IEC 14882:2014.

It is a mechanism for code reuse and to allow independent extensions of the original software via public classes and interfaces. The relationships of objects or classes through inheritance give rise to a hierarchy. Inheritance was invented in 1967 for Simula.\\nInheritance should not be confused with subtyping. In some languages inheritance and subtyping agree, while in others they differ; in general subtyping establishes an is-a relationship, while inheritance only reuses implementation and establishes a syntactic relationship, not necessarily a semantic relationship. To distinguish these concepts, subtyping is also known as interface inheritance, while inheritance as defined here is known as implementation inheritance or code inheritance. Still, inheritance is a commonly used mechanism for establishing subtype relationships."],"ns:common.topic.alias":["type polymorphism"],"rdfs:label":["Inheritance"],"key:en":["type_polymorphism"],"ns:education.field_of_study.subdiscipline_of":["ns:m.01mkq"],"ns:common.topic.article":["ns:m.07s257"],"ns:base.proofsareprograms.key_concept.key_contribution":["ns:m.05c772b"],"ns:book.book_subject.works":["ns:m.05c772j"],"ns:type.object.name":["Inheritance"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.topic"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:education.field_of_study"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1255bd737"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.028xmlk"],"key:user.avh.ellerdale":["0084-fcb2"],"ns:user.avh.default_domain.ellerdale_topic.ellerdale_id":["0084-fcb2"],"ns:base.schemastaging.context_name.pronunciation":["ns:g.125_lj93m"],"ns:common.topic.image":["ns:m.044l501"]}],"ns:common.topic.image":[{"ns:common.image.rights_holder_text_attribution":["-"],"ns:type.content.blob_id":["1e9802e3fe3773379ad8ed79764e64803309c7142bff1d0ee4c5e7778af78b55"],"ns:type.content.length":["21709"],"rdfs:label":["OOP"],"ns:common.licensed_object.provenance":["wikipedia,commons,188666"],"ns:common.image.size":["ns:m.044wg98"],"ns:type.content.source":["ns:m.044wg93"],"ns:common.licensed_object.license":["ns:m.05smz"],"ns:type.content.media_type":["ns:m.08wq"],"ns:type.object.name":["OOP"],"rdf:type":["ns:type.content"],"ns:common.image.appears_in_topic_gallery":["ns:m.0jgqg"]}],"ns:media_common.quotation_subject.quotations_about_this_subject":[{"rdfs:label":["C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off."],"ns:type.object.name":["C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off."],"rdf:type":["ns:media_common.quotation"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.12571z6q3"],"ns:media_common.quotation.author":["ns:m.017bd"],"ns:media_common.quotation.subjects":["ns:m.0jgqg"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.02hyl2s"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:media_common.quotation"]}],"ns:user.robertm.environmental_modelling.environmental_modelling_language_platform.models_implemented_with_this_language_platform":[{"rdfs:label":["LPJ-GUESS v2.1"],"key:en":["lpj_guess_v2_1"],"ns:common.topic.topical_webpage":["<http://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/erbrecht/lpjweb/lpj-lpjml-versions>"],"ns:user.robertm.environmental_modelling.environmental_model_implementation.model_description":["ns:m.02k_v_n"],"ns:user.robertm.environmental_modelling.environmental_model_implementation.completeness":["ns:m.02vhj_0"],"ns:user.robertm.environmental_modelling.environmental_model_implementation.download_site":["ns:m.02vjn0b"],"ns:common.topic.webpage":["ns:m.02vjm_z"],"ns:type.object.name":["LPJ-GUESS v2.1"],"rdf:type":["ns:user.robertm.environmental_modelling.topic"],"ns:user.robertm.environmental_modelling.environmental_model_implementation.language_platform":["ns:m.0jgqg"],"ns:common.topic.description":["LPJ Version 2: LPJ-GUESSLanguage: C++Main development period: \\n2000-ongoing (at Lund University)Citations to refer to the code: Sitch et \\nal.
