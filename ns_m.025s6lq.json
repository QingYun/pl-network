Originally focused on telecommunication systems, its current areas of application include process control and real-time applications in general.\\nThe Specification and Description Language provides both a graphical Graphic Representation (SDL/GR) as well as a textual Phrase Representation (SDL/PR), which are both equivalent representations of the same underlying semantics. Models are usually shown in the graphical SDL/GR form, and SDL/PR is mainly used for exchanging models between tools. A system is specified as a set of interconnected abstract machines which are extensions of finite state machines (FSM).\\nThe language is formally complete, so it can be used for code generation for either simulation or final targets.\\nThe Specification and Description Language covers five main aspects: structure, communication, behavior, data, and inheritance. The behavior of components is explained by partitioning the system into a series of hierarchies."],"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/2246590>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:type.object.name":["Specification and Description Language"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1254xhx_t"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"]}}
