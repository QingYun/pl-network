{"ns:m.0_lmkkm":{"ns:common.topic.description":["Pastel is an extended version of the Pascal programming language, created in c. 1982 for Amber, an operating system for the S-1 supercomputer project at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California.\\nPastel was conceived by Jeffrey M. Broughton, then Project Engineer in charge of compilers and operating system software for the S-1 project, because of dissatisfaction with the PL/1 language in which Amber was being implemented. The language was named Pastel and was the inspiration for Richard Stallman's GNU C compiler. Compared with Pascal compilers of that period, Pastel's features included:\\nImproved type definition\\nParametric types\\nExplicit packing and allocation control\\nAdditional parameter passing modes\\nAdditional control constructs\\nSet iteration\\nLoop-exit form\\nReturn statement\\nModule definition\\nException handling\\nGeneral enhancements\\nConditional boolean operations\\nConstant expressions\\nVariable initialization"],"rdfs:label":["Pastel"],"key:dataworld.freeq":["job_97bee9f2-44cd-48e5-a6e4-8fb0994e8ae6_var_en_wikipedia_org_wiki_Pastel_$0028programming_language$0029"],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1982"],"ns:type.object.name":["Pastel"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.1q3sdpcj7"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.05y49"]}}
