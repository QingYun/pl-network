It is the main programming language used by Apple for the OS X and iOS operating systems, and their respective application programming interfaces, Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.\\nThe programming language Objective-C was originally developed in the early 1980s. It was selected as the main language used by NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system, from which OS X and iOS are derived. Portable Objective-C programs that do not use the Cocoa or Cocoa Touch libraries, or those using parts that may be ported or reimplemented for other systems, can also be compiled for any system supported by GCC or Clang.\\nObjective-C source code program files usually have .m filename extensions, while Objective-C header files have .h extensions, the same as for C header files. Objective-C++ files are denoted with a .mm file extension."],"rdfs:label":["Objective-C"],"key:en":["objective-c"],"ns:common.topic.topical_webpage":["<http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/>"],"ns:common.topic.official_website":["<http://www.developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/>"],"ns:base.schemastaging.context_name.pronunciation":[{"ns:base.schemastaging.pronunciation.yomigana":["オブジェクティブ シー"],"rdf:type":["ns:base.schemastaging.pronunciation"]}],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_designers":["Tom Love"],"ns:common.topic.webpage":[{"ns:common.webpage.description":["The Objective-C 2.0 Programming Language"],"ns:common.webpage.category":["ns:m.08mbj32"],"ns:common.webpage.resource":["ns:m.0bm48jg"],"ns:common.webpage.uri":["<http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.webpage"],"ns:common.webpage.topic":["ns:m.05q31"]}],"ns:common.topic.article":[{"ns:common.document.source_uri":["<http://wp/en/39809523>"],"rdf:type":["ns:common.document"]}],"ns:common.topic.subject_of":["Treehouse"],"ns:computer.programming_language.developers":["Apple Inc."],"ns:computer.programming_language.introduced":["1986"],"ns:type.object.name":["Objective-C"],"rdf:type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:kg.object_profile.prominent_type":["ns:computer.programming_language"],"ns:common.topic.notable_for":["ns:g.125dtp8bx"],"ns:computer.programming_language.dialects":["ns:m.03clk94"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced":["ns:m.07sbkfb"],"ns:computer.programming_language.influenced_by":["ns:m.070d2"],"ns:computer.programming_language.parent_language":["ns:m.01t6b"],"ns:common.topic.notable_types":["ns:m.01xrl_t"],"ns:computer.programming_language.language_paradigms":["ns:m.05prj"]}}
